	- Made possible to lock not only time, but also space or both when viewing the timetable 
	(suggested by Horatiu Halmajan)
	- Small improvement: maximum room capacity and number of students for a set is now 15000,
	instead of 1000
	- Teachers free periods timetable by Volker Dirr
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Versions 5.5.0 - 5.5.9
- Version 5.5.0
	- Modified the algorithm (better or (hopefully not) worse)
	- Command line FET
	- Constraint teacher(s) max gaps per day
	- Constraint students (set) max gaps per week
	- Constraint students (set) early max beginnings at second hour
	- Subject tags are now named correctly activity tags
	- Constraints students set/teacher home room(s)
	- Buildings, building changes constraints
	- Constraint activities same starting day
	- Teachers, students sets, rooms, breaks not available matrices
	- Updated Romanian, Greek, Italian, Arabic translations by the persons in charge
- Version 5.5.1
	- Improved handling of multiple constraints preferred room for same activity (or same
	subject or same subject+activity tag) - suggested by Volker Dirr.
	- Improved Romanian translation.
	- Small improvements in the interface.
- Version 5.5.2
	- Small improvements in the interface.
	- Updated German and Indonesian translation.
	- Possibility to save current timetable in .fet form, with activities locked on their places
	(suggested by Horatiu Halmajan)
- Version 5.5.3
	- Crash bug fix - when adding a year with same name as a group or subgroup (reported by Volker Dirr)
	- Small interface improvements
	- Added checks to ensure that duplicate students sets are reported (suggested by Volker Dirr)
- Version 5.5.4
	- Greek, Romanian, Spanish translations updates
	- Small interface improvements
	- Added constraint 2 activities ordered, to allow to say: activity A2 must be after A1, separated
	by any number of days or hours (suggested by kdsayang)
	- Added constraint teacher(s) max hours continuously (suggested by kdsayang)
	- Added constraint students (set) max hours continuously (suggested by kdsayang)
	- When modifying a constraint min n days between activities, it checks for duplicates (suggested by kdsayang)
	- Crash bug fix (rare, if using home rooms with weight under 100% and rooms are constrained)
	- Added more tests to ensure home rooms inputted correctly
	- Generating multiple now saves each timetable in .fet form (suggested by kdsayang)
	- Increased number of days per week to 28, to allow exam scheduling (suggested by kdsayang)
- Version 5.5.5
	- Very small bug fix (very unlikely to happen, also the effect is almost null)	
	- Indonesian, Spanish and Arabic translation updates
	- Added an additional check for inconsistency
- Version 5.5.6
	- Arabic, Romanian, Spanish, Italian translations update.
	- Added an option to select all slots available or not available for constraints break, not available and preferred times
	(suggested by didit).
	- Added another Arabic sample by Hatim Alahmadi
- Version 5.5.7
	- Added 2 samples from Namibia (by Bobby Wise).
	- Added 1 sample from Namibia (by Willy Henckert).
	- Arabic and Greek translations updates.
	- Bug fix - now inactivating some activities allows to generate the timetable, because constraints referring to
	these activities are ignored (suggested by Yush Yuen).
	- Improvement - activating/deactivating activities for a year/group considers also the activities of included groups/subgroups
	(suggested by Yush Yuen).
- Version 5.5.8
	- Bug fix - when saving a timetable, regenerating it might give an impossible timetable - reported by Yush Yuen.
	This bug solved other possible important bug (I doubt someone observed this bug. What happens: if an
	activity has a fixed time, then when FET allocates it it fixes a room for this activity and consequent
	changes are not possible to reschedule this activity to another room - might give impossible timetable in extreme cases).
	Now it is possible to reallocate the room to another slot.
	- Improved add activity dialog - if min days is x (greater than 1) and weight is lower than 100.0%, user can add
	a second constraint with x-1 min days, to ensure activities are better separated.
	- Added advice to remove redundant min n days constraints when adding same starting time constraints.
	- Added another sample by Yush Yuen.
- Version 5.5.9
	- Added constraint activity(ies) preferred STARTING times, the old preferred times constraints are renamed preferred time slots
	and are more correct now, taking into consideration the duration of each activity (reported by Volker Dirr).
	- Allowing more constraint activity preferred starting times (or preferred time slots) for same activity id,
	which was restricted by a bug to only one. You can add more constraints with different weights.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Versions 5.6.0 - 5.6.4
- Version 5.6.0
	- Added import/export CSV (text with comma separated values) filters by Volker Dirr.
	- Added constraint min gaps between activities (suggested by several users).
	- Add activity dialog, checking/unchecking show years/groups/subgroups does not erase inserted sets (suggested by Zsolt Udvari).
	- Small bug fix when importing activities, consecutive if same day is not correctly imported (reported by daviodan).
	- Added Romanian help for export/import by daviodan.
- Version 5.6.1
	- Crash bug fix (probably very rare).
	- Added possibility to change easier more constraints min n days between activities
	- Added constraints subactivities preferred time slots and subactivities preferred starting times
	(suggested by Volker Dirr). You can specify the component number for subactivities, useful for constraining courses,
	say only the first or the last components of a split activity to be placed earlier.
	- Switched to Qt 4.4.0 and gcc 4.3.1
	- Indonesian, Romanian, Italian, German translations updates.
- Version 5.6.2
	- Added constraint teacher(s) and students (set) interval max days per week, to specify an hourly interval
	and the maximum number of days per week for teachers (students) to work in this interval (suggested by Hatim Alahmadi).
	This constraint is very useful, for instance specify that teachers and students must not work more than 2
	times per week in the last hour of the day.
	- Added constraint a set of activities end students day - to specify for a group of activities that they
	should end the day for students (for instance for meetings with the class master) - suggested by Zsolt Udvari.
	- Bug fix - when modifying a constraints (sub)activities preferred starting times or time slots, the activity tag
	is now correctly updated.
- Version 5.6.3
	- Crash bug fix (probably rare)
	- Added an -x- in the not available slots in teachers', students' and rooms' timetables
	(suggested by George Miliotis [Ionio]), added by Volker Dirr.
	- Added Lithuanian translation by Darius Staigys (incomplete yet).
- Version 5.6.4
	- Improved Arabic, Lithuanian and Italian translations.
	- Improved a very very rare situation (raised the maximum number of retries for a single activity from 100,000 to 200,000.
	This way, some saved timetables which contain constraints with weights close to 100% and below 100% (like 99.995%) are possible.
	Probably this situation is unnoticed by anybody). The possible problem is not perfectly solved, but it is a compromise.
	- Added possibility to mark or not -x- in the not available slots in timetables (suggested by Silvia, done by Volker Dirr).
	- Added all activities timetables by Volker Dirr (suggested by kdsayang)
	- Added exporting of timetable in csv form by Volker Dirr
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Versions 5.7.0 - 5.7.x
- Version 5.7.0
	- Added an advanced command to spread better the splitted activities in a week - very useful for schools, probably.
	- Minor interface improvement (in report duplicate activities routine)
	- Added status bar for File -> new, open, save and save as menus

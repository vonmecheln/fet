 7.5.5
	- An English field correction (reported by Vangelis Karafillidis).
	- Updated the Greek translation, by Vangelis Karafillidis.
 7.5.4
	- Changed the license of the program to the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (Volker Dirr suggested to remove the term 'or later').
	- Logic bugs fixed in the generation algorithm.
	- Added a new type of constraint, activities max total number of students in selected time slots (suggested by Furkan Kızılaslan).
	Unfortunately, this constraint might have a bad behavior in practice; we need to scrutinize it before using it, and use it only if strictly
	necessary.
	- Implemented additional keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+Shift+T/S/R for teachers/students/rooms days horizontal timetables. Also, the user can enable
	some other keyboard shortcuts from the Settings > Interface menu: + for adding, M for modifying, Delete for removing, A for activating, D for
	deactivating, C for comments, U for up, J for down, and W for weights (suggested by Alami Mohammed).
	- Minor improvements.
 7.5.3
	- Added a new and complete Turkish translation, by the newly assigned translator, Erdem Uygun (he was assisted by ChatGPT).
	- Updated the Vietnamese translation, which is now complete, by the newly assigned translator, Vũ Ngọc Thành (he was assisted by Gemini and ChatGPT).
 7.5.2
	- Updated to Qt 6.10.0.
	- The constraints of types room max activity tags per day/real day/week, teacher(s)/students (set) max activity tags per day/real day,
	and teacher(s)/students (set)/activities occupy max sets of time slots from selection will now accept any maximum limit, not just 1 or 2
	(suggested recently by moke, and suggested in the past by Thái Chí Phương and Vũ Ngọc Thành).
	- Code cleanup.
	- Updated the Italian translation, by Andrea Primiani.
	- Updated the Arabic translation, by Benahmed Abdelkrim.
 7.5.1
	- Updated to Qt 6.9.3.
	- Added a new type of constraint, activity(ies) begin(s) or end(s) teachers'/students' day (suggested recently by
	Nelson Gomes, and suggested in the past by ghani1990, Ali Doussary, YOUSSEF HOUIET, Željko Vrabec, and maybe other users).
	- Added a new type of constraint, activities occupy max sets of time slots from selection (suggested recently by k3nt0n, and
	maybe by other users in the past). The maximum value can be chosen by the user to be 1 or 2.
	- Memory and speed improvements for the constraints of type teacher(s)/students (set) max single gaps in selected time slots,
	teacher(s)/students (set) occupy max sets of time slots from selection, and teacher(s)/students (set) pair of mutually exclusive
	sets of time slots.
	- Changed the 'selected' symbol (now it is ✓) and the colors for the constraints with selected/not selected slots
	(suggested by k3nt0n, and by other users in the past). Rodica Lalescu suggested the new colors.
	- Other minor improvements.
 7.5.0
	- Added a new type of constraint, activities overlap completely or do not overlap (suggested by alege).
	- Minor interface improvements.
	- Corrected an Italian translation field, by Andrea Primiani (fixing an error reported by ggscuola).
 7.4.7
	- Minor interface improvements.
	- Added a keyboard shortcut, Ctrl+H, for the 'Timetable > Generate multiple' command (suggested by Alami Mohammed).
	- Corrected an Arabic translation field, by Benahmed Abdelkrim (fixing an error reported by Bachir Nacer Elhak Sayah).
 7.4.6
	- Updated to Qt 6.9.2.
	- Changed the (optional) colors in the dialogs for adding/modifying a constraint of type teacher(s)/students (set) occupy max sets of time
	slots from selection (constraint type which was introduced in the previous version), so that they are not similar to the (optional) colors
	in the dialogs for adding/modifying a constraint of type teacher/students set/room not available or (sub)activities preferred times, because
	the functionality is different (suggested by YOUSSEF HOUIET, who also suggested some of the colors; Rodica Lalescu also suggested some of
	the colors).
	- Added the option to reset all the spin boxes in the new constraint of type teacher(s)/students (set) occupy max sets of time slots from
	selection (constraint type which was introduced in the previous version) with a single click in the top-left corner of the table (suggested
	by GUEFFAZ REDA).
	- Updated the Brazilian Portuguese translation, by Alexandre R. Soares.
 7.4.5
	- Added a new type of constraint: teacher(s)/students (set) occupy max sets of time slots from selection (suggested recently by
	Sérgio Augusto Dias Castro; it was also suggested in the past by GUEFFAZ REDA and maybe other users; YOUSSEF HOUIET suggested
	the option to color the selected slots distinctively, and Andrea Primiani, the Italian translator, found some important English
	mistakes in the new constraint). The maximum value can be chosen by the user to be 1 or 2. This constraint might be useful for
	instance to constrain the teachers to work only maximum 2 shifts out of 3 per day.
 7.4.4
	- Added two new types of constraints: activities pair of mutually exclusive time slots and activities pair of mutually exclusive sets of
	time slots (suggested by Vũ Ngọc Thành).
	- The detailed description of the selected teacher in the teachers' dialog will show the total duration of his/her active activities
	(suggested by Bachir Nacer Elhak Sayah).
	- The program will keep the focus on the last pressed button in the dialogs which list the time/space constraints (suggested by more users,
	via YOUSSEF HOUIET).
	- A few English text fields were corrected/improved (reported by Volker Dirr, found using ChatGPT and Gemini).
	- A few Romanian translations were corrected/improved (reported by Volker Dirr, found using ChatGPT and Gemini).
 7.4.3
	- Added a new type of constraint: teacher(s)/students (set) pair of mutually exclusive sets of time slots (suggested by YOUSSEF HOUIET, and maybe
	other users in the past).
	- Code cleanup (fixing issues reported by Coverity Scan).
 7.4.2
	- Crash bugs fixed: if the user's file contained no activity tags, and if the user tried to add some time constraints for tags, such as teachers
	activity tag max hours daily, the program did not report the error and added the constraint with an empty tag, and later crashed with an assertion
	failed when editing that constraint or when trying to generate (reported by Bouazza El Idrissi, YOUSSEF HOUIET, and JoeLaw).
	- Code cleanup (suggested by Volker Dirr).
	- Updated the Bosnian translation, by Bolja škola.
 7.4.1
	- Bug fix: the activity tags' timetables of type time horizontal divided by days were always empty.
	- Other minor bug fixes in the interface.
	- Corrections/improvements in the generation of the HTML code for the timetables.
	- Updated the Italian translation, by Andrea Primiani.
	- Updated the Arabic translation, by Benahmed Abdelkrim.
	- Updated the Bosnian translation, by Bolja škola.
 7.4.0
	- Added a complete Bosnian translation, by Bolja škola (assisted by Google Translate and ChatGPT).
	- Some punctuation marks are now translated, because in some languages, like Arabic, they are different from the Latin ones (reported/suggested
	by Walid).
 7.3.2
	- Interface bugs fixed in the teachers'/students' not available times time horizontal dialogs: when using a right-to-left writing system,
	the lines separating the days were drawn incorrectly (reported by GUEFFAZ REDA).
	- Interface improvements: the selected filters in the dialogs listing the constraints will be preselected in the corresponding combo boxes when
	adding new constraints (suggested by Massimo Mancini).
	- Interface improvements: changed the alternative text of the "Pause" push buttons from "Resume" to "Continue" in the timetable generate
	single/multiple dialogs (this change was done for clarity, especially when this text is translated into other languages; we need the meaning of
	this text to be clearly different from the meaning of the "Restart" push button, which is near it in the timetable generate multiple dialog, and
	which has a totally different functionality: stop the current generation and begin a new different one).
 7.3.1
	- Crash bug fixed, when importing activities from CSV files (reported by KR_OBS).
	- Added the option to pause the timetable generation (suggested by russell, GUEFFAZ REDA, Nahum Lipkunsky, and maybe other users in the past).
	This option is available in the single timetable generation dialog and for each thread in the multiple timetable generation dialog but,
	unfortunately, it will not allow the user to exit FET and resume the generation; you will need to keep the program and the computer running
	(but, of course, the paused generations will not consume processing power). GUEFFAZ REDA had some useful additional suggestions regarding
	this new feature: to show the [PAUSE] text with a bold text, and to disable the text edit widget showing the progress, if paused.
	- Bug fixes: some texts were shown aligned to the left when using a right-to-left writing system (reported by GUEFFAZ REDA).
 7.3.0
	- Added the possibility of restarting a certain thread in the generate multiple timetables dialog (suggested by Yush Yuen).
	- Added the possibility of viewing the initial order of placing the activities in the generate multiple timetables dialog (suggested by Yush Yuen).
	- Corrections in the interface: when resizing the constraints' dialogs the list of constraints remained too small (reported by Yush Yuen).
 7.2.6
	- Corrected some instructions/documentation referring to the advanced function of removing the redundant constraints (the inaccuracies were reported
	by Yush Yuen).
	- Added the option to highlight the incompletely assigned teachers in the teachers' statistics, by comparing their target number of hours with their
	assigned list of activities (suggested by GUEFFAZ REDA).
	- Updated the Italian translation, by Andrea Primiani.
 7.2.5
	- Updated to Qt 6.9.1.
	- Updated the Arabic translation, by Benahmed Abdelkrim.
 7.2.4
	- Added a new type of constraint for the Terms mode: teacher(s) max hours per term (suggested by mikkojoo).
 7.2.3
	- Timetable generation code improvements in the new constraints of type teacher(s)/students (set) max single gaps in selected time slots (found with
	the help of Yush Yuen).
	- Bug fix: the option '--printteachers=[true|false]' of FET-CL was not correctly recognized, because of a typo in the source code (reported by samloba).
	- The inactive items (activities, subactivities, time constraints, space constraints, and group activities in the initial order items) will have a
	corresponding distinctive color (suggested by GUEFFAZ REDA).
 7.2.2
	- Bug fix: for partial timetables, the conflicts for the constraints of type teacher(s)/students (set) max single gaps in selected time slots were
	not logged.
 7.2.1
	- Added the constraints of type teacher(s)/students (set) max single gaps in selected time slots (suggested and tested by Yush Yuen).
	- The description of the constraints involving activities will now show an 'X' before the id if the activity is deactivated (suggested by GUEFFAZ REDA).
	- Minor interface bug fix: when restoring the default settings, the option 'The font is user selectable' was not updated correctly
	(reported by Vangelis Karafillidis).
 7.2.0
	- Minor interface bug fix (the bug was found by watching an online FET tutorial presented by Apisit Piamnoi).
 7.1.9
	- Minor bug fix: the hours' names and long names were not correctly separated by a new line character in the timetables if the user selected this
	option (reported by Željko Vrabec).
 7.1.8
	- Potential bug fix: the default translated names of some days of the week could have been the same, leading to critical bugs. Now we use generic default
	names for the days in any language: D1, ..., D5 (and H1, ..., H12 for the hours). Of course these can be changed by the user after the initial setup.
	- Potential bug fix: if the names 'year_name Automatic Group' or 'group_name Automatic Subgroup' are colliding, employ some anti-collision tricks.
 7.1.7
	- Bug fix in the command line version: if the user wrote the command to suppress the activity tags timetables, the program suppressed instead
	the activities timetables (reported by Nahum Lipkunsky).
	- The order of the entries in the ChangeLog file is now reversed (improvement made by Nahum Lipkunsky).
 7.1.6
	- Added a file communication protocol for the FET-CL executable, as suggested by Nahum Lipkunsky: if the user creates a file named exactly 'sigwrite',
	the program will output the current and highest stage timetables, without interrupting the generation, and remove this file from the disk.
	This facility was suggested also by other users in the past.
	- Improved the fet.desktop file by adding the possibility of opening a specified fet file on startup.
	- Added a mime file for GNU/Linux, so that it is possible to open directly a fet file with FET from the file browser; also in the file browser the fet
	files will have attached the FET icon (suggested by Željko Vrabec, who also wrote the fet.xml mime file). These features should be present on GNU/Linux,
	after doing a "make install", but you might need to execute some additional commands post-installation, as explained in the README file.
 7.1.5
	- Improved the preliminary feasibility test of the constraints of type teacher(s)/students (set) activity tag min hours daily.
	- Updated the Arabic translation, by Benahmed Abdelkrim.
	- Updated the Brazilian Portuguese translation, by Alexandre R. Soares.
	- Updated the French translation, by Pascal Cohen.
	- Updated the Greek translation, by Vangelis Karafillidis.
 7.1.4
	- Crash bugs fixed, in the dialog for modifying a constraint of type max activity tags from a set per day/real day/week for a room, when removing
	an activity tag (reported by Nguyễn Hữu Tuyên).
	- Improved the constraints of type teacher(s)/students (set) activity tag min hours daily - now they allow the user to specify the minimum required
	number of days per week with the selected tag (suggested by Nahum Lipkunsky).
	- Improved the data file structure.
	- Improved the resulted time horizontal timetables (suggested by Vangelis Karafillidis).
	- Updated the Greek translation, by Vangelis Karafillidis.
	- Updated the Italian translation, by Andrea Primiani.
	- Updated the Arabic translation, by Benahmed Abdelkrim.
 7.1.3
	- Added a new constraint in the Block planning mode, two sets of activities have the same sections (suggested by Edward Downes and Richard B. Gross).
	- Added the possibility of modifying multiple selected constraints at once, with a single click, for these types of time constraints: teacher min/max
	real days/mornings/afternoons per week, teacher min/max hours per real day, teacher min hours per morning/afternoon, teacher max hours per all afternoons,
	teacher mornings/afternoons early max beginnings at second hour, teacher max gaps per real day/per week for real days/per morning and afternoon
	(in the Mornings-Afternoon mode).
	- Updated the Greek translation, by Vangelis Karafillidis.
	- Updated the French translation, by Pascal Cohen.
	- Updated the Brazilian Portuguese translation, by Alexandre R. Soares.
 7.1.2
	- Updated to Qt 6.9.0.
	- Added advanced filters in the dialogs which list the time/space constraints (suggested by Vangelis Karafillidis).
	- Added the possibility of modifying multiple selected constraints at once, with a single click, for these types of time constraints: teacher min/max
	days per week, teacher min/max hours daily, teacher max hours continuously, and teacher max gaps per day/week (suggested by Vangelis Karafillidis).
	- Added the possibility of being informed by a beep and/or a notification command after each successful timetable in a multiple generation
	(suggested by Benahmed Abdelkrim).
 7.1.1
	- Updated to Qt 6.8.3.
	- Updated the Brazilian Portuguese translation, by Alexandre R. Soares.
	- Updated the Arabic translation, by Benahmed Abdelkrim.
	- Updated the Italian translation, by Andrea Primiani.
 7.1.0
	- Added the constraints of type teacher(s)/students (set) pair of mutually exclusive time slots (suggested by NYC FET, igorsch, and maybe other users
	in the past).
 7.0.8
	- Minor corrections in the resulted HTML timetables.
 7.0.7
	- Improved the fet XML file formatting (only the spacing was changed - the text should remain the same). This was suggested by ismailbsrn's file formatting.
 7.0.6
	- Bug fix in the constraints teachers not available time horizontal: the hidden rows might have been incorrectly modified (reported by GUEFFAZ REDA).
	This bug was introduced in the previous version.
	- The list/add/modify group activities in initial order items dialogs will have a 'Show related' check box for the students filter.
 7.0.5
	- Improved the add/modify constraints dialogs which include a times table: the user can click on the top-left corner instead of the button "Toggle all",
	button which will now toggle/swap empty (green) cells with X (red) cells. Suggested by Volker Dirr and gradgrind; gradgrind also suggested the main idea
	for coding this. Volker suggested to use the ∀ symbol in the top-left corner to express this functionality.
	- The add/modify constraints dialogs with tables will each have a separate option, a check box, for choosing whether to use colors or not (suggested
	by GUEFFAZ REDA).
	- Added filters in the constraints teachers/students not available time horizontal views (suggested by GUEFFAZ REDA).
	- The students filters in the dialogs for listing the constraints and in the dialogs for adding/modifying the constraints will have a 'Show related'
	check box (suggested by more users in the past).
 7.0.4
	- Implemented additional table cells/lines to better separate the different days in the time horizontal/vertical timetables (suggested by Pietro, Matsumoto,
	liquid, Mario, geokom, and maybe other users in the past).
	- When modifying the constraints which include times tables, the slots marked with X will be bold (it was an inconsistent behavior, compared to adding such
	constraints, and it was reported by infoo_).
	- Added a swap button in the constraints which include times tables, to swap the empty (green) cells with the cells marked with X (red). Suggested by infoo_.
 7.0.3
	- Minor improvements.
	- Corrected and improved the German translation, by Volker Dirr (following a bug report by uni_instructor).
 7.0.2
	- Minor improvements.
 7.0.1
	- Updated to Qt 6.8.2.
	- Improved the reporting of warnings/errors in the command-line version (suggested by Nahum Lipkunsky). The potential warnings/errors issued before the
	generation will be written in their respective file, instead of being written on the console. The special UTF-8 characters will be correct in this case.
 7.0.0
	- Improved the algorithm: the constraints of type min days between activities with the weight < 100% were previously treated a little differently than the
	other constraints with the weight < 100% (the min days between activities constraints were privileged: the algorithm tried a bit harder to respect them).
	Now, all the constraints with the weight < 100% will be treated similarly. This implies that the files containing constraints of type min days between activities
	with the weight < 100% will be solved possibly faster, but with possibly more broken constraints of this type. So, you might need to increase the weights of the
	constraints of type min days between activities with the weight < 100%.
	- Updated the Russian translation, by Alexey Chernous.
 6.28.7
	- Minor interface improvements.
	- Source code typos corrected (found with the help of Nahum Lipkunsky).
 6.28.6
	- Added the option to sort alphabetically the constraints in their specialized dialogs (suggested by Vangelis Karafillidis).
	- Improved the timetable view dialogs, as suggested by GUEFFAZ REDA: you can choose whether to merge the table cells which correspond to the same activity
	(by default selected) and whether to use colors (by default not selected), and the timetable views by days horizontal/vertical will show the number and
	the duration of the displayed activities.
 6.28.5
	- Improved the divide year by categories dialog, as suggested by Vangelis Karafillidis: added the option to copy the categories and divisions from another
	students year, and added the option to make the first category permanent. On this occasion there was corrected a possible crash bug in this dialog.
 6.28.4
	- Crash bugs fixed, if trying to add constraints teacher/teachers max hours daily in an hourly interval with max hours daily = 0. Reported by math.
	- The timetable views days horizontal/vertical now contain check boxes to show/hide the teachers, the students, the subjects, the activity tags,
	and the rooms (suggested by GUEFFAZ REDA).
 6.28.3
	- Updated to Qt 6.8.1.
 6.28.2
	- Bug fix when modifying a constraint of type max half days between activities (hopefully not met in practice).
	- Bug fix for the constraint activity preferred room: the 'permanently locked' check box was always initialized as selected when editing this kind
	of constraint.
	- The constraints with times tables will show the real days and the real hours in the Mornings-Afternoons mode (suggested by more users in the past).
	- The user can choose to overwrite the files of the previous single generation (suggested by Thai Chi Phuong, Benahmed Abdelkrim, pnlshd, bharatstank,
	and maybe other users).
	- Code improvements.
 6.28.1
	- Interface bug fixed: the combo boxes could be too large in the constraints' dialogs (reported by uni_instructor).
	- Improved the dialogs for adding/modifying the constraints of type two activities ordered, two activities ordered if same day, two activities
	consecutive, two activities grouped, and three activities grouped (suggested by uni_instructor).
	- Improved the instructions/help for some constraints (suggested by uni_instructor).
 6.28.0
	- Converted the interface files for the time and space constraints. There are much less source files now. This implies more things:
	shorter compilation time, smaller package sizes, less fields to translate and smaller translation files, nicer looking constraints' dialogs.
	Also, the dialogs listing the constraints of a certain type allow multiple selection, and have buttons for activating/deactivating the constraints,
	change the constraints' weights in bulk, and set the comments for a constraint. Qt Creator and Valgrind were invaluable tools for this work.
	- Improved the activity planning dialog when swapping the teachers, if one cell was empty (suggested by uni_instructor).
 6.27.0
	- It is now possible to change the interface style and color scheme (but only when using Qt version 6.8.0 or later).
	- Added the option to add/remove an activity tag to a selection of (sub)activities with a single click (suggested by Benahmed Abdelkrim and pnlshd).
	- Added a note to the constraints referring to an interval, that the start hour is included and the end hour is not included (suggested by Pier,
	and other users in the past).
	- Minor improvements.
 6.26.2
	- Corrected some rare cases of old timetable files possibly being overwritten when generating single timetables.
	- Minor improvements.
 6.26.1
	- In the command-line version, the newly generated timetables will be put in a new directory each time. The old timetables won't be overwritten.
 6.26.0
	- Updated to Qt 6.8.0.
	- The newly generated timetables will be put in a new directory each time. In the single generation, the old timetables will not be overwritten and
	in the multiple generation the user will not be forced to remove the old timetables before generating. Suggested by pnlshd, and other users in the past.
	- Updated the Arabic translation, by Benahmed Abdelkrim.
 6.25.3
	- Updated to Qt 6.7.3.
	- Updated the Brazilian Portuguese translation, by Alexandre R. Soares.
 6.25.2
	- Added the constraint room max activity tags from a set per week (suggested by YOUSSEF HOUIET). This constraint accepts as the maximum number of
	tags 1 or 2, and must be assigned to a real (not virtual) room, room which also does not appear in any set of real rooms of any virtual room.
	- Enabled the use of constraints teacher(s)/students (set) activity tag max hours daily in the Mornings-Afternoons mode (suggested by hoangnv231).
	- Added the option to print the legend starting with and ordered by the codes in the timetables (suggested by M.zais).
	- Improved the Italian translation, by Andrea Primiani.
 6.25.1
	- Added the constraints room max activity tags from a set per day/real day (suggested by Thai Chi Phuong). This constraint accepts as the maximum
	number of tags 1 or 2, and must be assigned to a real (not virtual) room, room which also does not appear in any set of real rooms of any virtual room.
	- Minor improvements.
	- Updated the Brazilian Portuguese translation, by Alexandre R. Soares.
 6.25.0
	- Added the constraints teacher(s)/students (set) max activity tags from a set per day/real day (suggested by Thai Chi Phuong and Vũ Ngọc Thành).
	This constraint accepts as the maximum number of tags 1 or 2, and incorporates the old-style constraints teacher(s)/students (set) max two
	activity tags per day/real day from N1, N2, N3.
	- Added the constraints teacher(s) no two consecutive days (suggested by Khelifi Fouad Mohssen).
 6.24.1
	- Added the option to change with a single click the weights of a whole selection of time/space constraints (in the all time/space constraints dialogs)
	(suggested by Bahri Abderezak on Facebook, and maybe other users in the past).
	- After generating a new timetable, if some timetable view days horizontal/vertical dialogs were already opened, they will remember their selected
	teacher/students set/room (suggested by Kamel Ben on Facebook). Also, in all the timetable view dialogs, the current cell will be remembered
	(but not the whole selection of cells, if there are more cells selected).
 6.24.0
	- Unlocked the imperfect constraints and the advanced features and removed their usage warnings (suggested by more users in the past).
	They are working very well in practice and the menu locks and warnings are not needed. The exception is the advanced 'Group activities
	in the initial order of generation' option.
	- Removed the warnings referring to the constraints of type activities occupy min/max time slots from selection and activities min/max simultaneous
	in selected time slots (suggested by potrempe, fourat, and YOUSSEF HOUIET). The constraints are highly optimized and work very well in practice.
	- The comments in the timetables will no longer have an italic font (suggested by Cyrus Ireri).
	- Other minor interface improvements.
 6.23.0
	- Very rare but critical crash bugs fixed, in the Mornings-Afternoons mode (reported by Anonymous participant on a Facebook group about scheduling).
	- Very rare crash bugs fixed (if when printing the teachers'/students' statistics the radio button 'Days vertical' was selected, the program crashed).
	- Minor bug fixes and improvements in the output of the timetables.
	- The printing of the timetables from the interface now works also when using a right-to-left writing system (suggested by Benahmed Abdelkrim,
	Mohamed Ait Ichou, and maybe other users in the past). The exception is when printing the statistics. Redha Rahmane reported on a Facebook group
	about scheduling an important bug found in the first test version, which was fixed in the final version.
	- Printing the timetables from the interface will now center the tables (only horizontally). Suggested by Muhammad Ratrout on Facebook, and by
	Benahmed Abdelkrim.
	- Updated the Brazilian Portuguese translation, by Alexandre R. Soares.
 6.22.3
	- Added the option to print the legend (summary of names, long names, codes, and comments) of the used subjects, activity tags, teachers, students,
	and rooms in the timetables (suggested by mskalsi and maybe other users in the past). The feature is disabled by default and can be enabled from
	the 'Settings -> Timetables -> Data to print in timetables' menu.
	- Minor corrections and improvements in the output of the timetables (mskalsi suggested a larger font for the institution name. While we did not implement
	exactly this, we set a bold font for the institution name. Also, this is done through the CSS file, so the user can change this behavior if needed).
	- Improved the Italian translation, by Andrea Primiani.
 6.22.2
	- Corrected the main form appearance under older Qt versions.
	- Minor improvement: added an explanation about how the constraints of type students (set)/teacher(s) max room/building changes per week work
	(suggested by Vũ Ngọc Thành and Volker Dirr).
	- Updated the Italian translation, by Andrea Primiani. It is now complete.
	- Improved the Brazilian Portuguese translation, by Alexandre R. Soares.
	- Corrected the Romanian translation, by Liviu Lalescu (the typos/small errors were found using Ispell / Aspell).
 6.22.1
	- Updated to Qt 6.7.2.
	- Corrected and improved the output of the HTML timetables (reported/suggested by Cyrus Ireri).
	- Added the teachers/students/rooms days vertical options when viewing the timetable from the interface (suggested by Mohamed Ait Ichou,
	YOUSSEF HOUIET, and maybe other users in the past).
	- Corrected the timetable view dialogs when using a right-to-left writing system (previously, the separation lines were drawn incorrectly).
	Reported by Benahmed Abdelkrim.
	- Minor improvement: removed the brackets in the menu entries for viewing the timetables (suggested by Volker Dirr).
	- Updated the Italian translation, by Andrea Primiani.
 6.22.0
	- Added long names for the days, real days (in the Mornings-Afternoons mode), hours, and real hours (in the Mornings-Afternoons mode), and
	long names and codes for the subjects, activity tags, teachers, students, buildings, and rooms. Also, it is now possible to choose from the Settings menu
	which of this information to print in the timetables (suggested by Jude G, Cyrus Ireri, and other users). Cyrus Ireri helped with testing and reports,
	and Benahmed Abdelkrim found and reported a critical bug for the Mornings-Afternoons mode (which was fixed in the final version).
	- Minor bug fix in the import from CSV files (reported by Darren McDonald).
 6.21.1
	- Critical bug fix in the Mornings-Afternoons mode, when saving the locked fet file (the real days per week and the real hours per day were not saved).
 6.21.0
	- In the Mornings-Afternoons mode the timetables will show/use the real days/hours (suggested by Mohamed Ait Ichou, danghoan, Hieu Nguyen Trong, and
	maybe other users). TongThanhKieu suggested thicker lines between the morning and the afternoon in the timetable view teachers/students/rooms
	days horizontal dialogs.
	- Very rare crash bugs fixed when reading a corrupted input file (reported by vlaicumihnea).
 6.20.0
	- Updated to Qt 6.7.1.
	- Added two new types of constraints: teacher(s)/students (set) min gaps between activity tag/ordered pair of activity tags between morning and
	afternoon, in the Mornings-Afternoons mode (suggested by victorcapel).
	- Minor bug fixes: when using the activity planning dialog and activating/deactivating activities/subactivities using the activate/deactivate buttons
	(as opposed to selecting/deselecting the 'active' check box from the modify activity/subactivity dialogs, which worked correctly), the activity planning
	dialog was not updated immediately (reported by Cyrus Ireri).
 6.19.5
	- Corrected the two Windows batch files which start the program in the Fusion and Windows styles, to take care of possible space characters in the
	path to the FET executable (bug reported by Khafallah Oualid).
	- Minor corrections.
 6.19.4
	- Minor corrections.
 6.19.3
	- Minor improvement to the highlighting of the selected row(s)/column(s) in the time horizontal view of the teachers'/students' not available times.
 	- Code cleanup.
 6.19.2
	- Bug fix: when opening a file on program startup with the command "fet filename.fet", the recent files list was not updated correctly with the file's
	complete path, if it was not specified (this bug was introduced in the previous version).
 6.19.1
	- Updated to Qt 6.7.0.
	- You can now open a file directly when starting the FET interface: "fet filename.fet" (recently suggested by Cyrus Ireri, and also suggested in
	the past by MING-KIAN JONATHAN CEDRIC LEE KIM GNOK, Volker Dirr, and maybe other users).
	- Better highlighting of the selected row(s)/column(s) in the tables (suggested by Cyrus Ireri, who also contributed with a bug report on the new code).
	- Minor bug fixes, by Volker Dirr, when printing the timetables / advanced statistics from the interface.
	- Code cleanup.
 6.19.0
	- Updated to Qt 6.6.3.
	- Added two new types of constraints: teacher(s)/students (set) min gaps between activity tag/ordered pair of activity tags per real day, in the
	Mornings-Afternoons mode (suggested by victorcapel). On this occasion some bugs in the routine used to check the final timetable were corrected
	(they did not affect the generation). Benahmed Abdelkrim contributed with a bug report on the new code.
	- Minor bug fix: if the user changes the mode to Mornings-Afternoons, the constraints of type min/max days between activities will be adjusted if
	necessary (if the number of min/max days between activities is greater than the new number of real days per week).
	- Minor bug fix in the description of the recorded history state when adding multiple constraints of type activities same starting hour / occupy
	max different rooms. Also, now the order of the added constraints is given by the id of the first activity from each constraint.
	- Minor bug fix: when reading a wrong file containing an activity without a specified subject, FET will report an error on reading the file
	instead of possible assertions failed when trying to edit the data or generate the timetable (reported by vlaicumihnea).
	- Added a "Black" check box option in the statistics print from the interface, so that the fonts won't be gray, but black (suggested by Cyrus Ireri).
	On this occasion, a minor correction was done in the exporting of the advanced statistics to the disk (if the HTML level was 7 - colors, the fonts
	of line 2 should have been black, not gray).
	- Minor change: The section "Timetable_Generation_Options_List" (which may contain elements of type "GroupActivitiesInInitialOrder") will be printed
	even if it is empty.
	- Added four new example files, by Alexey Chernous.
	- Added three new example files, by activityum.
	- Updated the Russian translation, by Alexey Chernous.
 6.18.1
	- Minor bug fixes in some English fields.
	- Minor bug fixes / improvements when reading an invalid file (reported by Cyrus Ireri).
	- Updated the Brazilian Portuguese translation, by Alexandre R. Soares. It is again complete.
	- Updated the Greek translation, by Vangelis Karafillidis. It is again complete.
 6.18.0
	- Minor bug fixes: if there were no teachers in the file and the user added multiple constraints, one for each teacher, there were recorded
	useless history points.
	- Added a new type of constraint: teacher(s) / students (set) max room changes per (real) day in an hourly interval (suggested by giardiniere and
	other users in the past).
 6.17.0
	- Updated to Qt 6.6.2.
	- Crash bug fixed when spreading the activities evenly over the week (this bug was introduced in FET version 6.12.0, released on 13 November 2023).
	Reported by GUEFFAZ REDA.
	- Minor improvement: if the spreading of the activities evenly over the week does not affect the data, there will not be registered a new history state.
	- Other minor bug fixes and improvements.
	- Added a new type of constraint: teacher(s) / students (set) max building changes per (real) day in hourly interval (suggested by Vũ Ngọc Thành
	and other users in the past). Unfortunately, for some files using constraints referring to the building changes the timetable generation speed might
	decrease with about 2% - 4%. For a file with many constraints referring to building changes we even noticed a 12% speed of the generation decrease,
	but this is hopefully very rare.
	- Added a new type of constraint: teacher(s) / students (set) max hours daily in an hourly interval (suggested by Cyrus Ireri, and in the past by many
	other users). This constraint type can be used, apart from its primary purpose, to set a dynamic break for the teachers / students.
 6.16.1
	- The constraints of type activity(ies) begin(s)/end(s) student(s)'/teacher(s)' day are now allowed to have weight <100% (suggested by maxi_mus).
	- Minor improvements in some English fields.
	- Minor code improvements.
 6.16.0
	- Many source code updates and improvements (using ideas from Volker Dirr).
	- Minor bug fix in the interface (reported by Volker Dirr).
	- Minor improvement when saving the history data file (using ideas from Volker Dirr).
	- Updated the Bulgarian translation, by Hristiyan Dimitrov, who is the new translator.
 6.15.1
	- Correction for saving/retrieving the history on/from the disk: if the data structure changes, the history will be invalidated, instead of
	possible bugs/crashes of the program (using an idea of Volker Dirr).
	- Updated the Brazilian Portuguese translation, by Alexandre R. Soares. It is again complete.
 6.15.0
	- Added the possibility of saving the history to the hard disk, next to the saved .fet data file (suggested by uni_instructor and ngoctp29121982).
	This option is by default disabled and can be enabled from the settings.
	- Minor improvements in the memory consumption (the details of the history operations are now stored archived).
	- Code cleanup.
 6.14.2
	- The 'printable' option of the activity tags will be considered when exporting the generated timetable as a CSV file (so that the nonprintable
	activity tags will not appear). Suggested by pnlshd.
	- Code cleanup.
 6.14.1
	- Critical crash bugs fixed, when removing space constraints from their dialogs (not from the 'all space constraints' dialog)
	(reported by gerry). These bugs were present since FET version 6.12.0, released on 13 November 2023.
 6.14.0
	- Implemented the HTML exporting and the printing of the timetables for the buildings (suggested by Benahmed Abdelkrim).
	- Minor corrections in the HTML exporting and in the printing of the timetables.
	- Code cleanup.
 6.13.2
	- Updated to Qt 6.6.1.
	- Bug fix: when generating multiple from the GUI or generating from the command-line with a time limit, for some impossible timetables
	the generation could go on indefinitely without respecting the specified time limit. The bug was introduced in version 6.7.3, which was released
	on 24 November 2022.
	- Added an additional test for the feasibility of the generation in the Mornings-Afternoons mode (suggested by sunnysolanki76).
	- Code cleanup.
 6.13.1
	- Crash bugs fixed, when working with the new 'History' feature and locking/unlocking activities from the 'Timetable view' dialogs
	(reported by Vangelis Karafillidis). These bugs appeared in version 6.12.0, with the introduction of the 'History' feature.
	- Minor interface bug fixes (reported by Volker Dirr).
	- Code cleanup.
 6.13.0
	- Added a kind of data file autosave feature (suggested by mohammed, Vangelis Karafillidis, DT, and maybe other users). This feature is optional,
	and by default it is disabled (it can be enabled from the 'File > Autosave settings' menu entry).
	- If the description of the operation to be logged in history is too large, it will be truncated to maximum 20,000 characters, so that the history
	won't occupy too much memory.
	- When printing the timetables from the interface, without colors, the user can select the option that all the fonts will have the black color,
	instead of gray and silver being used for some categories of text (suggested by Nikandros and Volker Dirr).
	- Updated the Arabic translation, by Benahmed Abdelkrim. It is again complete.
 6.12.0
	- Added an undo/redo system (actually, the possibility of saving and restoring data states to/from history). Suggested by: Massimo Mancini, uni_instructor,
	Anthony Siaudeau, Zsolt Udvari, pekuon, and maybe other users. DT had some useful suggestions regarding this new feature.
	- The confirmation for activating/deactivating activities/time constraints/space constraints can now be disabled (suggested by pnlshd).
	- The dialogs for activities/all time constraints/all space constraints now contain a count of the selected items (suggested by pnlshd).
	- Minor improvements.
	- Updated the Russian translation, by Alexey Chernous.
	- Updated the Brazilian Portuguese translation, by Alexandre R. Soares. It is again complete.
 6.11.1
	- Minor improvements in the time horizontal view dialogs of the teachers / students not available times, which were introduced in the previous FET version.
	Suggested by Liviu Lalescu and Vangelis Karafillidis.
	- Improvements in the dialogs of not available times for teachers / students and teachers / students / rooms timetable view time horizontal,
	the lines separating the days are thicker.
	- Other minor improvements.
 6.11.0
	- In the dialogs of all activities, all time constraints, and all space constraints, the list of activities / time constraints / space constraints
	is multi-selectable (suggested by T. Renganathan, Yush Yuen, daviodan, Lizio, fartoto_dz2004, Vangelis Karafillidis, and maybe other users).
	- Added an option in the dialogs add time / space constraints for the teacher(s), so that you can now add individual constraints for each teacher
	with a single click (suggested by Valdo, Julio González Gil, utismetis, Davide Cottignoli, mercurialuser, auriolar, Rodolfo Ribeiro Gomes, pg788, satellite2,
	Zafar Allah Askar, nouvakis, mbarsan, pgsrihr, Massimo Mancini, Chafik Graiguer, Vangelis Karafillidis, Fritzlang, wojgp, and maybe other users).
	- Implemented a time horizontal view of teachers / students not available times constraints (suggested by Vangelis Karafillidis). These views
	are accessible from the teachers / students time constraints menus.
	- The cells in the three timetable view time horizontal dialogs can now be made very small, so that you can have a better view of the overall timetable.
	- Minor bug fixes / improvements in the export of the timetables if using HTML level 6.
	- Minor improvements.
 6.10.0
	- Important bug fixes and improvements concerning the advanced function of removing the redundant constraints. Some of the bugs were present since
	the introduction of this function, in FET version 5.7.1, released on 6 October 2008, and others were present since the introduction of the facility
	to activate/deactivate constraints, in FET version 5.16.0, released on 12 December 2011.
	- Added the option to show/hide the subjects, teachers, students, and rooms, in the Print dialog and in the HTML timetables, in addition to
	the already existing facility of this type for the activity tags. Suggested by Silver, Drago, xtzetzias, and maybe other users.
	- Updated the German translation, by Volker Dirr.
 6.9.7
	- Updated to Qt 6.6.0. This involved updating the FET code in many places (using an easy search-and-replace), to get rid of the many new
	compilation warnings (referring to the use of the deprecated function qAsConst). Now you will need a C++17 complying C++ compiler to compile FET.
	- Minor improvement in an English field.
 6.9.6
	- Updated to Qt 6.5.3.
	- Very rare crash bugs fixed (reported by Rouge Rosé).
	- Code cleanup.

	- Corrected a few English fields, by Vangelis Karafillidis.
	- Updated the Greek translation, by Vangelis Karafillidis.
 6.9.3
	- Updated to Qt 6.5.2.
	- The activities import/export from/to CSV files will now process correctly the individually modified teachers, subjects, activity tags,
	and students of the subactivities. The different components will be separated by the | symbol. Suggested by ngoctp29121982 and Volker Dirr.
	- Corrected a few English fields, by Vangelis Karafillidis.
	- Updated the Greek translation, by Vangelis Karafillidis.
 6.9.2
	- Minor improvements in the add/modify constraint min half days between activities dialogs, when using the Mornings-Afternoons mode
	(suggested by Vũ Ngọc Thành).
	- Updated the Russian translation, by Alexey Chernous.
 6.9.1
	- Updated to Qt 6.5.1.
	- Corrected a few English fields, by Vangelis Karafillidis.
	- Updated the Italian translation, by Andrea Primiani.
	- Updated the Greek translation, by Vangelis Karafillidis.
 6.9.0
	- Updated to Qt 6.5.0.
	- Added two batch files for Windows, making it possible to start the FET interface in the Fusion or Windows styles (suggested by Volker Dirr).
	Unlike the standard Qt style, these styles respect the dark mode on the Windows operating system, if the user selected it (starting with
	Qt version 6.5.0).
	- Improvement: if there are present 'group activities in the initial order' items in the data file, but all of them are inactive,
	there will not be issued a warning regarding this advanced feature at the start of the generation of the timetable.
	- Improved the dialog of 'group activities in the initial order' items.
	- Code cleanup (suggested by Volker Dirr, found using the function 'Analyze > Clang-Tidy and Clazy' of Qt Creator).
	- Updated the Italian translation, by Andrea Primiani.
	- Updated the Greek translation, by Vangelis Karafillidis.
 6.8.7
	- Updated to Qt 6.4.3.

	- Interface bug fixes.
	- Code cleanup.
	- Updated the Brazilian Portuguese translation, by Alexandre R. Soares.
 6.8.0
	- Added an advanced filter in the activities/subactivities dialog (similar to the existing advanced filter in the all time/space constraints dialog).
	Also, it is now simpler to activate/deactivate the (sub)activities in these dialogs - there were added activate/deactivate buttons, such that it is no longer
	needed to enter the "Modify (sub)activity dialog". Also, it is now possible to activate/deactivate with a single button all the listed (filtered) (sub)activities.
	Also, in the all time/space constraints dialog, it is now possible to activate/deactivate with a single button all the listed (filtered) time/space constraints.
	Suggested by Horațiu Hălmăjan, Yush Yuen, Constantin Romulus, Nguyễn Hữu Duyệt, noddy11, Anthony Siaudeau, Vangelis Karafillidis, and Liviu Lalescu.
	- Various improvements and minor bug fixes.
	- Updated the Romanian translation, by Liviu Lalescu.

 6.7.8
	- Updated to Qt 6.4.2.
	- Code cleanup.
 6.7.7
	- Interface improvement: in the activities dialog, in the list of time constraints directly related to the selected activity, there will be shown the related
	constraints of type teacher/students set not available times.
	- Minor improvements.
	- Code cleanup.
 6.7.6
	- Interface bug fix: in the activities dialog, in the list of space constraints directly related to the selected activity, the constraints of type teacher/students
	set home room(s) which affected this activity were not shown. Reported by giardiniere and Volker Dirr.
 6.7.5
	- Minor corrections.
	- Code cleanup.
 6.7.4
	- Added the possibility to select, in the Mornings-Afternoons mode, instead of min days between activities, the number of min _half_ days between activities,
	when adding activities from the interface or when importing them from CSV files (suggested by ngoctp29121982, whose advice was very useful).
	The export of the activities to CSV files in this case is also updated (if there are constraints of type min half days between activities, they will be exported
	in a format compatible with the importing).
	- Code cleanup.
 6.7.3
	- Bug fix: when generating an impossible file on multiple threads, the program could hang (discovered with the help of math). The bug was isolated with the help
	of GDB (GNU Debugger).
	- Improved the generation on some locked timetables for which the program would report impossible generation, even if these files were solved when they were
	unlocked (reported by math).
 6.7.2
	- Updated to Qt 6.4.1.
	- Minor improvements.
 6.7.1
	- Crashing bugs fixed, when generating multiple on more threads (hopefully they are all fixed now, and hopefully no new ones are introduced. If you experience
	crashes or lockings of the program while generating single or multiple on more threads please report them).
	- Minor improvements.
 6.7.0
	- Added simple support for the credit hour system (American system) (suggested by Imad). The new feature is that you can add multiple constraints
	of type activities same starting hour / activities occupy max different rooms with a single click.
	- Corrected a few compiler warnings (some reported by Clang, some reported by the new Qt 6.4.0).
	- Updated the Russian translation, by Alexey Chernous.
	- Updated the Vietnamese translation, by Phạm Văn Quyền Anh.
 6.6.2
	- Minor bug fixes in the reporting of the soft conflicts, when having some types of time constraints related to inactive activities.
	- Updated the Arabic translation, by Benahmed Abdelkrim.
	- Updated the Vietnamese translation, by Phạm Văn Quyền Anh, who is again the assigned translator (he translated also in the past).
 6.6.1
	- Added a complete Italian translation, by Francesco Rizzo, who is the new translator.
 6.6.0
	- Updated to Qt 6.3.2.
	- Added a new type of constraint in the Mornings-Afternoons mode, students (set)/teacher(s) min hours per afternoon (suggested by bachiri401 and Hocine Berrou).
	- Bug fixes when modifying/removing subjects/activity tags/students sets/teachers attached to constraints of type activities begin students'/teachers' day
	(reported by YOUSSEF HOUIET).
	- Updated the Russian translation, by Alexey Chernous.
	- Updated the Brazilian Portuguese translation, by Alexandre R. Soares.
 6.5.7
	- Added a new type of constraint, teacher(s) max span per day, in the Mornings-Afternoons mode (suggested by Phạm Văn Quyền Anh). (This constraint type was
	already implemented for the other modes, but in the Mornings-Afternoons mode there was available only the constraint type teacher(s) max span per real day.)
	- Updated the Brazilian Portuguese translation, by Alexandre R. Soares.
 6.5.6
	- Added a new type of constraint: activity(ies) begin(s) students'/teachers' day (suggested by Henrique Belo).
 6.5.5
	- Added a new type of constraint, max half days between activities, in the Mornings-Afternoons mode (suggested by Mohamed Ait Ichou and fourat).
 6.5.4
	- Added a new type of constraint, teacher(s) min days per week, in the Mornings-Afternoons mode (suggested by Abdeljalil Elghazoui and Benahmed Abdelkrim).
	(This constraint was already available in the other modes, but in the Mornings-Afternoons mode there was available only the constraint type teacher(s)
	min real days per week.)
	- Added a new example file from Algeria, by Benahmed Abdelkrim.
	- Updated the Russian translation, by Alexey Chernous.
 6.5.3
	- Updated to Qt 6.3.1.
	- Minor interface bug fixes: in the timetable view teachers/students/rooms days horizontal, the cells marked with -x- or -X- were sometimes shown
	with bold, italic, or underlined font when changing the teacher/students set/room if there were locked activities in the timetable.
 6.5.2
	- Added a new type of constraint, students (set) max two activity tags from N1, N2, and N3 per day, in the Mornings-Afternoons mode
	(suggested by Ali Doussary).
	- Added a new type of constraint, teacher(s)/students (set) max two activity tags from N1, N2, and N3 per real day, in the Mornings-Afternoons mode
	(suggested by Ali Doussary).
	- Added a new type of constraint, teacher(s)/students (set) max building changes per real day, in the Mornings-Afternoons mode
	(suggested by Phạm Văn Quyền Anh and Ngọc Ngô Minh).
	- Improvements in the constraints teacher(s)/students (set) max two activity tags from N1, N2, and N3 per (real) day (in the Mornings-Afternoons mode).
	- Minor improvements for the Mornings-Afternoons mode, suggested by Ngọc Ngô Minh.
	- Updated the Vietnamese translation, by Ngọc Ngô Minh, who is the new translator.
 6.5.1
	- Bug fix in the Terms mode: decreasing the number of terms will now report the number of affected constraints (of type 'max terms between
	activities' and 'activities occupy max terms') and update them correctly.
	- Improved the teachers and students XML output timetable files, by including the id-s of the activities in the time slots (suggested by Fred).
 6.5.0
	- Important generation bug fix, when using constraints of type students (set) max span per (real) day. This bug was found with the help of
	Vangelis Karafillidis. Unfortunately, this bug fix means that the generation might take longer (for the contrived example
	FET-5-official/Romania/Pedagogic-High-School-Tg-Mures/2007-2008_sem1-d-test-students-max-span-per-day.fet the generation time might
	be even with 50% longer on average). But the algorithm is correct now and hopefully on real-life examples the behavior will be better;
	for this same contrived example, cycling (which is very very bad), which appeared when locking the activities to days, is not a problem anymore.
	- Bug fixes in the interface: when modifying the number of hours per half day in the Mornings-Afternoons mode, the constraints of type
	'max span per real day' were forced to reduce their maximum span to the number of hours per half day, not to the number of hours per real day.
	- Added two new types of constraints for the Terms mode: activities min in a term and max terms between activities (suggested by mikkojoo).
	- Added a new example file from Algeria, by Benahmed Abdelkrim.
 6.4.0
	- Improvement: now the algorithm won't put more than two subactivities from the same larger activity on the same day (real day for the
	Mornings-Afternoons mode), even if 'consecutive if same day' is not selected (suggested by Benahmed Abdelkrim). Unfortunately, some locked timetables
	might become impossible with this change - in this case please unlock them and generate again.
	- Added a new type of constraint in the Mornings-Afternoons mode: min half days between activities (suggested by ngoctp29121982, with a further
	suggestion by bachiri401).
	- Added the option to lock activities to their scheduled day, useful for timetables which change over the year, due to teacher arrival/leaving.
	This option is available in the students/teachers view timetable time horizontal dialogs. Suggested by Vangelis Karafillidis and Alexey Chernous.
	- Improved the behavior of the timetable view students/teachers/rooms days horizontal dialogs, as suggested by Vangelis Karafillidis.
	- Updated the Romanian translation, by Liviu Lalescu.
	- Updated the Russian translation, by Alexey Chernous.
	- Updated the French translation, by Pascal Cohen.
	- Updated the Brazilian Portuguese translation, by Alexandre R. Soares.
	- Updated the Arabic translation, by Benahmed Abdelkrim.
 6.3.4
	- Minor improvements.
	- Minor correction in the Arabic translation, by Benahmed Abdelkrim.
	- Updated the Russian translation, by Alexey Chernous.
 6.3.3
	- Interface bug fix: when switching from a language with a right-to-left layout to one with a left-to-right layout, the interface layout remained
	right-to-left.
	- Code cleanup.
	- The Arabic translation will now use Western Arabic numerals (suggested by Walid and Benahmed Abdelkrim).
 6.3.2
	- Updated to Qt 6.3.0.
	- Minor improvements.
	- Updated the Russian translation, by Alexey Chernous.
 6.3.1
	- Updated to Qt 6.2.4.
 6.3.0

	- Improvement in the speed of generation in the Mornings-Afternoons mode.
	- Minor bug fixes.
 6.2.8
	- Minor improvements.
 6.2.7
	- Updated to Qt 6.2.3.
	- The font of the text of the interface is now customizable (suggested by Khelifi Fouad Mohssen). This font type will also be applied when printing
	the timetables (suggested by agemagician).
 6.2.6
	- Potential crash bug fix (most certainly not met in practice).
	- More detailed reports when reading a .fet file with wrong teachers, subject, activity tags, or students sets in the activities list. Suggested by math.
	- The search for updates on startup will now also send the current Qt version to the server.
 6.2.5
	- Added a new type of constraint, teacher(s)/students (set) min gaps between activity tag (suggested by uni_instructor and Thaneswer Patel).
	- Added an 'inverted' option for the filter in the activities and subactivities dialogs, to see the activities which are _not_ related to the
	selected filter (suggested by uni_instructor, with further suggestions by Volker Dirr).
	- The print preview dialogs will retain their size and position (suggested by Thaneswer Patel).
	- Corrected the US English original strings (many typos/small errors were found using Ispell / Aspell).
	- Corrected the Brazilian Portuguese translation, by Alexandre R. Soares (some typos/small errors were found using Ispell / Aspell).
	- Updated the Bulgarian translation, by Asen Pashov.

	and there were activities having none of these tags. Reported by Mohamed Ait Ichou. Other minor bugs were fixed in these constraints
	(the description of the constraints, and an activity should not have more than one tag from these three, if using these constraints relating
	to its teacher(s)).
 6.1.0
	- Updated to Qt 6.1.2.
	- Added the import/export of comments from/to CSV (comma separated values) files (suggested by Darren McDonald).
	- Added two new example files from South Africa, by Eric Carolus.
	- Updated the Russian translation, by Alexey Chernous.
 6.0.4
	- Updated to Qt 6.1.1.
	- Bug fix in the timetable generate multiple dialog, when generating on multiple threads: if the generation time limit was reached and if the limit
	on the total number of generated timetables was reached, the highest-stage solutions of some of the timetables generated in the last round were missing
	in the final results.
 6.0.3
	- Updated to Qt 6.1.0.
	- Code cleanup.
	- Added three new example files, by Jijo Jose (two from India and one from South Africa).
 6.0.2
	- Crash bugs fixed when using Qt 5.15.2, reported by ghani1990. The exact locations with wrong code were found using gdb.
	- Bug fix: the program was using some uninitialized variables (discovered with Valgrind). But this did not affect the generation.
 6.0.1
	- Bug fix when importing the teachers from a CSV file in the mornings-afternoons mode. This bug would eventually lead to a crash
	(assertion failed) when viewing the teachers list. Reported by Khineche Kaddour.
 6.0.0
	- Updated to Qt 6.0.3.
	- Increased the limits of the generation algorithm (the new limits are most probably more than enough for everybody).
	- Combined the most important custom versions into the official FET. The new feature is called "mode" and it can be:
	"official", "mornings-afternoons" (for Morocco and Algeria), "block planning", and "terms" (for Finland).
	- The multiple generation can be done on multiple threads, each timetable on a separate thread. Multiple timetables should
	be obtained much faster if you have a multi-core/hyper-threading processor.
	The following people, listed in chronological order, contributed to this release: bachiri401 (thorough testing), Alexey Chernous (testing),
	Darren McDonald (testing and bug reports), DT (suggestions), Chichi Lalescu (suggestions), YOUSSEF HOUIET (testing and bug reports),
	and the translators: Benahmed Abdelkrim (Arabic), Robert Hairgrove (German), Alexandre R. Soares (Brazilian Portuguese),

	max gaps constraints or with more than zero max gaps allowed.
	- Added a warning if using constraints of type teacher(s)/students (set) max hours daily with weights less than 100%, because the algorithm
	is not perfectly implemented in this case.
	- The automatic division of years by categories will now retain the settings for each year, separately (suggested by Eric Carolus and possibly other users).
	- Minor code improvements (suggested by Volker Dirr).
 5.46.1
	- Increased the maximum number of hours per day to 72 (suggested by Celia22).
	- Added help/information in the add/modify constraint activity preferred room dialog (suggested by math).
	- Minor improvements.

	- Code cleanup.
 5.44.7
	- Code improvements/cleanup in the generate function.
 5.44.6
	- Minor fixes in the all time/space constraints dialogs.
	- Removed the warning that was issued when the user selected a higher HTML level for the generated timetables (if the selected HTML level was 3 or higher,
	the program warned of possible large file sizes).
	- Minor code improvements.
	- Code cleanup.
 5.44.5
	- Minor fixes and code cleanup.
 5.44.4
	- Bug fix: the program froze when hiding rows or columns in the activity planning dialog. This bug was introduced in version 5.43.0. Reported by Dietmar Deuster.
	- Code improvements.
 5.44.3
	- Minor fixes and code cleanup.
 5.44.2
	- Bug fix: when using constraints activity tags not overlapping with the activity tags names containing the special characters &, >, or < (and possibly " or '),
	the saved file would be corrupted and could not be reopened without firstly correcting it manually. Reported by Darren McDonald.
 5.44.1
	- Updated to Qt 5.14.2.
	- Updated the Arabic translation, by Benahmed Abdelkrim.
	- Minor fixes.
 5.44.0
	- Changed the random number generator to a better one, MRG32k3a, by Pierre L'Ecuyer (used with permission). This has a longer period but, unfortunately,
	on some older/not so powerful computers/platforms (especially the 32-bit ones), this new random number generator might run (much) slower. But the generation
	time should be generally nearly the same or comparable, since the random numbers generation routine seems to take only about 3% of the generation time.
	- Bug fix for the future Qt versions: Qt reverted back from the signal QComboBox::currentIndexChanged(int, const QString &) used in their snapshot
	to the signal QComboBox::currentIndexChanged(int). The combo boxes should now work correctly with the future versions of Qt.
	- Code cleanup.
 5.43.2
	- Corrected a compiler error appearing with the future Qt versions (this bug was introduced in FET version 5.43.0: the function
	QNetworkReply::error() will not be obsolete and the replacement function QNetworkReply::networkError() was dropped. So we needed
	to revert this also in the FET code, otherwise we would get a compiler error with the future Qt versions).
	- Updated the code for the future Qt versions: removed usage of the soon-to-be obsolete constant QString::SkipEmptyParts
	(the future constant will be Qt::SkipEmptyParts).
 5.43.1
	- Minor bug fix: the constraint students (set) max days per week allowed a minimum value of 0 max days per week. Now the minimum value is correctly 1.
	Reported by bachiri401.
	- Slightly improved the dialogs for the constraints of type activity/subject/activity tag/subject+activity tag preferred room(s) (suggested by bachiri401).
	- Code update/cleanup.
 5.43.0
	- Updated the code for the future Qt versions: removed usage of QLinkedList, of Java-style iterators, of the soon-to-be obsolete function
	QNetworkReply::error(), and of some obsolete Qt signals, and changed from endl to Qt::endl in the necessary places.
	These changes are not visible to the user.
	- Many code improvements/cleanup in the interface part.
	- Exporting of the advanced statistics to the disk now centers the text contents of the table cells.
	- Improved the command-line usage instructions (suggested by Zsolt Udvari). They are now easier to read. Also, running the command-line
	version will create log/results files/directories only if an input file is given.
 5.42.3
	- Updated to Qt 5.14.1.
	- When opening a file containing unrecognized XML tags, FET will issue a warning and indicate their locations. Reported by math.
	- Minor fix/improvement for the Mac OS X version: the "About FET" menu item was shown/executed incorrectly (reported by Darren McDonald and math).
	Also, with this occasion, the "Quit" menu item was linked to the specific recommended menu place for this platform.
	- Minor improvements.
	- Updated the Spanish translation, by Emiliano Llano Díaz.
 5.42.2
	- Minor improvements.
 5.42.1
	- Bug fix: the command-line version of FET did not remove the file logs/difficult_activities.txt before a new generation, if it was written
	by a previous unsuccessful generation.
	- Minor code improvements and cleanup.
	- Added more proper acknowledgments and references for the used libraries.
 5.42.0
	- Updated to Qt 5.14.0.
	- Corrected many warnings appearing with the new Qt 5.14.0 (about using deprecated Qt functions).
	- Minor speed improvements when using the constraints involving room/building changes for students/teachers.
	- Crash bug fixed when reading a file which was not in the FET XML format (probably not met in practice). Now FET reports that it is an
	incorrect file.
	- Bug fix: when opening the students' timetable view days horizontal dialog with the subgroups list variant selected, the details for the
	current activity were not shown. Also, in this case, locking the selected activities did not work. Reported by math.
	- Minor bug fixes in the activity planning dialog: when swapping the teachers/students, their initial order in the related activities
	might not have been preserved.
	- Code cleanup.
 5.41.0
	- Implemented these types of constraints: teacher(s)/students (set) activity tag min hours daily (suggested by Chafik Graiguer, Pietro,
	Vangelis Karafillidis, Benahmed Abdelkrim, s.lanore, and maybe other users). These constraints types are not perfect and must be enabled
	from the settings menu.
	- Implemented the constraint type activities occupy min time slots from selection (suggested by flauta, Vangelis Karafillidis, and math).
	- Implemented the constraint type activities min simultaneous in selected time slots (suggested by Vangelis Karafillidis).
	- Implemented these types of constraints: teacher(s)/students (set) max room changes per day/week, and teacher(s)/students (set) min gaps
	between room changes (suggested by Benahmed Abdelkrim, abdeljalil elghazoui, otman hashem, Ahmed El Hawary, Abdellah Sabri, khatou1973,
	nachrach111, Omar Ben Ali, forstera, and maybe other users).
	- Code improvements in the generation code of the constraints of type teacher(s) max span per day when allowing a one day exception of
	max span plus one.
	- Code improvements in the generation code of the constraints of type activities occupy max time slots from selection
	and activities max simultaneous in selected time slots.
	- Improved the activity planning dialog, by Volker Dirr (one improvement - to swap the students sets - was suggested by uni_instructor).
	- The activity planning dialog is now accessible by a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+A in English, maybe other letters in other languages)
	(suggested by uni_instructor).
	- Removed a useless computation that was done after the generation (suggested by Marco Diego Aurélio Mesquita).
	- Various other code improvements/cleanup.
	- Added a new example file from Algeria, by Lysso.
 5.40.3
	- Updated to Qt 5.13.2.
	- Code cleanup.
	- Added two new example files from Syria, by Zafar Allah Askar.
 5.41.0
 5.40.2
	- Various rare but important bug fixes concerning the new feature of virtual rooms.
	- Small memory leak bug fixed (when reading incorrect files with virtual rooms).
	- Minor fixes and improvements.
	- Added a new example file from Greece, by dimzev.
 5.40.1
	- Bug fix: if using virtual rooms, when generating a new timetable and locking it, some constraints of type activity preferred room could be added again,
	even if they were already present, if the real rooms chosen for the virtual room were the same but in a different order (the order should not matter).
 5.40.0
	- Updated to Qt 5.13.1.
	- Added virtual rooms, which give the possibility for the user to specify more rooms for an activity, or to choose between a large room or more smaller
	rooms for an activity, and might open the possibilities for other kinds of usage. Suggested by math on the forum, who had some very useful ideas.
	These users also suggested more rooms for an activity: Volker Dirr, Anton Anthofer, dasa, Thaneswer Patel, and amin.
	Unfortunately, this feature might make FET about 5-10% slower even if you are not using virtual rooms, and I apologize for this,
	but virtual rooms are useful.
	- Added the possibility to allow a one day exception of max span plus one for the constraints of type teacher(s) max span per day
	(suggested by totera, Luca, and bachiri401).
	- Bug fix: now it is not allowed to run FET command-line on files which do not contain any activity.
	- Minor bug fix when using constraints with weights having 5 or 6 digits after the decimal dot (like 99.999975%). This minor bug did not affect
	the generation, only the final report of the (soft) conflicts.
	- Minor bug fix in the import of the rooms and of the buildings, by Volker Dirr.
	- Added a new example file from Romania, by rapsy.
 5.39.0
	- Added a new type of constraint: activity tags not overlapping (suggested by Henrique Belo).
	- Speed improvement in the pre-generation routine, if the data file contains constraints of type activities not overlapping.
 5.38.1
	- Updated to Qt 5.13.0.
	- Very rare crash bug fixed, when executing fet-cl on an incorrect input file with the option to export the CSV files. Reported by Xingxing.
	- Code cleanup (fixed some compiler warnings which appeared with the new Qt 5.13.0).
 5.39.0
 5.38.0
	- Updated to Qt 5.12.3.
	- Added a new type of constraint: min gaps between an ordered pair of activity tags for a students set / all students / a teacher / all teachers,
	suggested by Nagendra and other users.
	- Bug fixes and code cleanup.
	- Minor bug fix: the modify constraint room not available times dialog did not allow the weight to be set to 0%, a value which should have been permitted.
	Reported by math.
	- Added two new example files from Hungary, by Madas Pál.
	- Added a new example file from Tunisia, by fourat.
	- Added a new example file from India, by Nagendra.
 5.37.5
	- Minor improvement (automatic check for updates also sends to the server the user's processor architecture type, as other programs usually do) - suggested
	and implemented by Volker Dirr.
	- Updated the translations.
 5.37.4
	- Automatic check for updates on startup is working correctly now (using fixes found on Stack Overflow and on Amin Ahmadi's site).
 5.37.3
	- Updated to Qt 5.12.0.
	- When compiling with Qt 5, FET uses the better QRegularExpression class instead of the deprecated QRegExp class (which is only used if the user
	compiles with the old Qt 4).
	- Crash bug fixed when adding a constraint min days between activities and the number of the days per week is 1 (probably very rare).
	- Improved the import: the automatic selection of fields will now work even if there is no text quote around the fields (suggested by Jude G,
	implemented by Volker Dirr).
	- Minor string fixes in the CSV import/export dialogs.
	- Minor improvement: the attributes of the file fet.desktop, found in the sources archive of FET, were corrected.
 5.37.2
	- Fixed a compilation problem when using Qt >= 5.0.0 and < 5.7.0. Reported by yakup.
	- Crash bug fix (usually not met in practice), when opening a file containing duplicate activities id-s. Reported by Ahmed Ben Hassan.
	- Updated the Arabic translation, by Benahmed Abdelkrim.
	- Volker Dirr's site now uses SSL (https protocol instead of http).
 5.37.1
	- Rare crash bug fixed, appearing when viewing the timetable, then modifying some data (like increasing the number of days per week or hours per day)
	without closing the timetable view dialogs, and then regenerating. Reported by liquid.
	- The opened timetable view dialogs are now better updated after a successful or unsuccessful generation (suggested by Volker Dirr).
	- The constraints of type subactivities preferred starting times and subactivities preferred time slots now include a 'duration' filter (suggested by
	Léo-Paul Roch and Volker Dirr).
	- The limit for the maximum number of generated timetables in a multiple generation is increased from 100 to 1000 (suggested by Volker Dirr).
	- Code cleanup (suggested by Volker Dirr).
 5.37.0
	- Code update: removed the dependency of the obsolete Qt 'foreach' keyword (suggested by Volker Dirr). The speed of generation is improved by 5%-25%,
	depending on the data file. Now you need a C++11 compliant compiler to compile FET.
	- Updated the German example files from secondary school 1, by Volker Dirr.
	- Updated all the example files to use the latest file format.
 5.36.2
	- When viewing the activity details in the timetable view dialogs, if a room is allocated for this activity, there will also be shown the
	building and the capacity of this room (suggested by Diego Froner).
	- Added the feature of locking and unlocking all the activities having attached a certain activity tag (suggested by Diego Froner).
	- Bug fix in the unlocking of activities of a certain day if the timetable was not generated: If the user selected only space unlocking, no activities
	were unlocked.
 5.36.1
	- Updated to Qt 5.11.1.
	- The add activity, modify activity, and modify subactivity dialogs now have an option to show all the teachers or only the qualified teachers for
	the chosen subject (suggested by Volker Dirr).
	- The main check boxes and radio buttons in the activities, subactivities, add activity, modify activity, and modify subactivity dialogs now save
	and restore their state (suggested by Volker Dirr).
	- Added information about potential privacy issues if enabling the 'Search for updates on startup' option.
	- Updated the Arabic translation, by Benahmed Abdelkrim.
 5.35.7
	- Updated to Qt 5.11.0.
	- Corrected a few compilation warnings that appeared in FET when using the new Qt 5.11.0.
	- Code cleanup (by Volker Dirr).
	- Improved the command-line operation on Windows (since this platform misses/ignores SIGTERM, we use instead SIGBREAK to write the current and
	highest-stage timetables, then stop the program). Suggested by svenvanhal.
 5.36.0
	- Added a new constraint, two activities are ordered if they are on the same day (suggested by math).
	- The students' combo boxes can now be shown in three styles: simple (the old style), with icons, or categorized (suggested by math).
	- The view students' timetable days horizontal dialog was improved. Now the user can see the timetable for each year/each group/each subgroup (as before),
	for all years/each group/each subgroup, or for all years/all groups/each subgroup. Suggested by math.
	- The languages dialog now contains the untranslated description of each language (suggested by Volker Dirr).
	- Corrected a command-line bug: argument '--warnifusinggroupactivitiesininitialorder=true|false' was ignored. Reported by svenvanhal.
	- Corrected two compilation warnings (reported by Innocent De Marchi).
	- Corrected two bugs in the German translation (reported by math).
	- Corrected a few bugs in the translations.
 5.35.6
	- Minor strings bugs fixed (reported by Vangelis Karafillidis).
	- Updated the Greek translation, by Vangelis Karafillidis. It is now complete.
 5.35.5
	- Bug fix when using the old Qt 4: the special characters in the Help->About dialog were incorrectly displayed (bug introduced in the previous version, 5.35.4).
	- Minor fix: the example file translations/test-all-constraints.fet which should contain all the types of constraints was missing two of them. Corrected.
	- Updated the Greek translation, by Vangelis Karafillidis.
 5.35.4
	- Fixed two compilation errors under the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler (reported by Volker Dirr). Now FET can be compiled with this compiler.
	- The Help->About dialog of FET is now easily translatable into other languages (suggested by Rodolfo Ribeiro Gomes, Innocent De Marchi, and other users).

	Suggestions and code by Rodolfo Ribeiro Gomes. Also, there were used suggestions and code found on qtcentre.org, in a post by ChrisW67.
	- Improved the translation procedure of some fields. Suggestion and code by Rodolfo Ribeiro Gomes.
	- Minor strings bugs fixed (reported by Vangelis Karafillidis).
	- Improvement in the Romanian translation: instead of a cedilla, the special characters ș, ț, Ș, and Ț now use a small comma beneath them
	(as recommended by dexonline.ro and cum-scriem-corect.blogspot.ro).
 5.35.0
	- Bug fix: when unplugging a display, the dialogs which were previously shown on this display were not shown correctly on the remaining active display(s)
	(instead, they were invisible). Reported by kdrosos and sigit_yuwono.
	- Minor bugs fixed (reported by Vangelis Karafillidis).
	- Added a partial Japanese translation, by Taro Tada.

 5.27.6
	- Updated the sources to gcc-5.2.1 (but the Windows version still uses MinGW 4.9.2).
	- Minor improvements to the timetable and the statistics printing, by Volker Dirr (improved the margins handling).

	- Crash bug fix (probably never met, when using overlapping years) and improvements when removing students sets. Now you can completely remove a
	subgroup/group from a single button.
	- Added a test to report subgroups which have the same activities, so that the user can make generation faster by removing equivalent subgroups
	(if the user checks that the subgroups also have the same constraints).
	- Added a selectable option to show tool tips in the add/modify constraint dialogs which use tables (the tool tip is the day and the hour under
	the current cursor position). Suggested by Bob Hairgrove.
	- Updated the German translation, by Bob Hairgrove.
	- Code cleanup.
 5.26.0

	- Improved the speed of adding/modifying the (sub)activities from the corresponding dialogs (not noticeable, in usual cases).
	- Other speed improvements in the interface.
	- Leak and crash bug fixes (not usually met).
	- Some minor strings improvements.
	- Code cleanup.
 5.25.0
	- Improved the split year dialog: groups and subgroups which will exist in this year after the division will retain their activities and constraints.
	- Sort (temporarily) the constraints by description in the all time/space constraints dialogs. Also, removed the 'Sort by comments' button,
	which is probably useless.
	- Fixed a bug introduced in version 5.24.0: when having individually modified activities, removing teachers, subjects, activity tags,
	or students sets could remove only some components of the large split activity.
	- Some minor strings improvements.
 5.24.0

	and you don't use them in the interface).
	- Added options to select the categories of timetables to write on the hard disk.
	- Automatic division of years by categories is improved (suggested by alxgudea, Bobby Wise and Volker Dirr).
	- Code improvement in reading the .fet XML files: converted from the obsolete Qt classes QDom* to QXmlStreamReader. It brings
	speed and memory improvements when reading the input files, and ensures FET source compatibility with future Qt versions.

	but of course older files are opened correctly.
	- Several bug fixes, when trying to open corrupt files.
	- Other bug fixes, reported by Vanyo Georgiev.

	- Fixed a building problem under C++11 (reported by pkgsrc packager Thomas Klausner, solved by Jörg Sonnenberger).
 5.23.1
	- The teachers' timetables now show the list of teachers for team teaching; also the students' timetables now show the list
	of students sets for team teaching or show the students set of the activity if it is different from the currently selected
	students set (suggested and implemented by Volker Dirr).
 5.23.0
	- Updated to Qt 5.3.1.
	- Added a new timetabling generation option, to group selected activities in the initial order, next to the activity which is
	placed the earliest (suggested by Yush Yuen). This is useful in very rare cases of peculiar usage of constraint activities
	occupy max time slots from selection, or if you want to change the initial order of the activities by bringing some activities
	into front.
	- Improved the timetable shortcuts tab, by adding the print, locking and advanced push buttons.
 5.22.0

	- Made a separate command-line interface without using the X-screen (suggested by Danny Zitzman, Zsolt Udvari and maybe other users).
	- Made generation identical on all computers, by modifying QSet handling in the parts where the generation depends on the order of
	elements in a QSet (the elements are sorted and randomized, then). A minor bug was corrected with this occasion.
	- Now you can split a year into 4 categories (suggested by Bobby Wise).
	- When starting FET, the first shortcuts tab section (File) is selected (suggested by a user).

	- Updated to Qt 4.8.2.
	- Added a new sample file (by L. W. Johnstone, from Belize).
 5.18.0
	- Very serious old bug fix. This was found trying to implement the new constraint (see below) in such a way to solve a more complicated file
	by Yush Yuen. Since nobody complained, it seems that until now the bug was not critical (but might have slowed down some timetables which have
	rooms and preferred/home rooms constraints). Bug exists from the start of the implementation of the space allocation in FET, probably.
	A big 'Thank you!' to Yush Yuen, who was very helpful in finding the problem.
	- Added a new constraint, activities occupy max different rooms (which can, for example, constrain some activities to be in the same room
	(in different time slots, of course) if max different rooms = 1). Suggested by Yush Yuen, nomad, Volker Dirr and maybe others.
	- Safe saving of .fet files (save with .fet.tmp name, then remove old .fet file, then rename .fet.tmp to .fet).
	- Saving of the random seed after the end of the generation (in addition to saving it at the beginning).
	- Added an Uzbek translation, by Orzubek Eraliyev.

	- Added a new Greek sample file, by Petros Nouvakis.
 5.16.1
	- Updated to Qt 4.8.0.
	- Bug fix: command line interface now accepts native file separator characters (reported by Sarwan Bangar).
	- When using command line with a time limit, and the time limit is exceeded, FET will save the highest stage and the current timetable.
	Suggestion and code by Ian Holden.
	- Exporting of the timetable as a CSV file now saves also the activities comments (suggested by m, implemented by Volker Dirr).
	- Minor bug fix in HTML timetables, by Volker Dirr.
	- Minor interface bug fixes.
 5.16.0
	- Each constraint can be activated/deactivated and also each constraint may have an optional comment. The user can sort the constraints
	based on their comment. These special functions can only be accessed from all time/space constraints dialogs (suggested by George Miliotis,
	Davide G. M. Salvetti and maybe other users).
	- Each activity may have an optional comment (suggested by K, m and maybe other users).
	- The command line version now saves the current timetable and the highest stage timetable if it receives SIGTERM from the user, then exits
	(suggested by Davide G. M. Salvetti and maybe other users).
	- Added a Vietnamese translation, by Nguyen Truong Thang.
	- Minor interface bug fixes.
	- Updated the Saudi Arabia examination timetable file, by Silver.
 5.15.0
	- Added two new constraints:
	1) Activities occupy max time slots from selection. This is useful in more cases, for instance to force
	some teachers to have activities in certain time slots. (For example, if in a 5 days week with 6 hours per day, teacher T has 20 hours of
	activities and needs to have activities in the first 3 hours of Monday: add a constraint with all the teacher's activities,
	all time slots minus these 3 (so 5*6-3=27 slots selected in the constraint), and specify the maximum number of selected time slots occupied
	by the selected activities to be 17.) Suggested by Zsolt Udvari, Christian Kemmer, Davide G. M. Salvetti, lalloso, Silver, and maybe other users.
	2) Activities max simultaneous in selected time slots. User chooses a set of activities, a set of time slots, and specifies
	that in each time slot there should be an upper limit on the activities from the chosen set. Useful for example if you want each slot
	to have say at least 3 free teachers, for substitution or supervision.
	- Updated to Qt 4.7.4.
	- Removed dependence of Qt3Support classes. Many dialogs were changed. This is to improve FET and to prepare it for the future Qt 5.
	- The program is now storing the geometry of most dialogs (suggested by more users. Zsolt Udvari suggested to store also the
	Activity planning dialog settings).
	- The activity tags, students, teachers, subjects, rooms, buildings, activities, subactivities, all time constraints
	and all space constraints dialogs contain a draggable splitter, for better viewing (suggested by daviodan).
	- Taking care of when a file was modified. When it was not modified, the user can quit FET directly (suggested by Horatiu Halmajan and maybe other users).
	- Recently used files list (suggested by daviodan, Silver and maybe other users).
	- Activities rooms statistics - it shows the list of activities which will certainly or possibly be scheduled in an unspecified room
	(suggested by Volker Dirr, who also did a part of the coding, Corfiot, Fabio Piedimonte).
	- Removed the upper limit on the number of time and space constraints.
	- When modifying the days or hours, the affected constraints will be modified or removed, after confirmation from the user.
	- Language change is activated without restarting.
	- Many other interface improvements.
	- Added a new sample file, by Silver.
	- Improved the Morocco sample file and the Morocco instructions (by Liviu Lalescu and Chafik Graiguer).
 5.14.5
	- Updated to Qt 4.7.3.
	- The generate multiple timetable dialog now shows max placed activities for the current timetable and for each timetable with time limit exceeded
	(suggested by Yush Yuen).
	- Non-critical interface bug fix under Mac OS X: in the add and modify activity dialogs, the tab widget for the subactivities was too large, showing
	all the 35 possible components. Bug reported by Yush Yuen.
	- Minor interface bug fix under Mac OS X: the dialogs now show minimize/maximize buttons. Bug reported by Yush Yuen.
	- Minor improvement in the HTML exported timetables (multi-line comments look better), by Volker Dirr.
	- Added a Galician translation, by Juan Marcos Filgueira Gomis (based on the Spanish translation, as of April 2011, by Jose Cesar Fernandez Lopez).
	- Added a Spanish secondary school example file, by llantones.
 5.15.0
 5.14.4
	- Upgraded to Qt 4.7.2.
	- Updated the French translation, by Regis Bouguin (it is now complete).
	- Added a complete Serbian translation, by Ivan Starchevicy and Radan Putnik.
	- Minor improvements.
	- Added 3 new sample files, by waleed, M K Lohumi and Asti Widayanti.
 5.14.3
	- Upgraded to Qt 4.7.0.
	- Improved the Greek translation, by Dimitris Kanatas.
	- Minor interface improvements.
	- Added two new sample files, by Massimo Mancini and Dimitris Kanatas.
 5.14.2
	- A rare possible problem is improved (not completely solved). This problem was reported by Marco Barsotti: for some fixed timetables the generation
	may report incorrectly an impossible timetable. This problem cannot be solved perfectly, only patched, and this will hopefully solve the problem
	in all practical situations.
	- An activity can now be split into 35 (it was previously only 10) - suggested by mohd on the forum.
	- Improved a bit the add/modify activity dialogs (inactive tabs for the components of a subactivity are disabled).
	- Updated the Slovak translation, by Ondrej Gregor.
	- Added a new sample file, by Marco Barsotti.
 5.14.1
	- Speed improvement in the generation algorithm (this speed improvement is better observable as the number of hours per week is larger).
	- Added a partial Hebrew translation, by Yotam Medini (only the main menu).
 5.14.0
	- Improved the random number generator, so that potential cycling problems are avoided (though probably nobody met such problems).
	The new random number generator has a much longer period and is better. The command line parameters for specifying the random
	seed are changed and you need to change your script if you use FET command line and if you want to specify the random seed.
	See the README file for the new command line parameters for specifying the random seed.
	- Improved memory consumption on constraints activity/activities/subactivities preferred starting times/preferred time slots.
	- Minor interface improvements.
	- Updates in the Arabic translation, by Silver.
 5.13.5
	- Corrected a bug, under newer versions of GNOME (the locked/unlocked icons for the special constraints were not shown in the menus).
	- Very rare bug fix (crash in import if some fields in a line are missing, reported by murad).
	- Other minor bug fixes in import (if an imported line was incorrect, the report message didn't specify this line number, in some cases).
	- Updated the Indonesian translation, by Nirwan Yus.
	- Updated the Spanish translation, by Jose Cesar Fernandez Lopez.
	- Code cleanup
 5.13.4

	- Rare minor bug fixed, reported by Frans on the forum.
	- Code cleanup.
 5.13.2
	- Increased max activities from 15,000 to 30,000 (suggested by murad). Also, increased max time constraints from 30,000 to 60,000 and max space constraints from 30,000 to 60,000.
	- Added a partial Sinhala translation (only the main menu), by Achini Duisna.
	- Updated the Indonesian translation, by Nirwan Yus.
	- Very rare crash bugs fixed.
	- Code cleanup.
 5.13.1

	constraints students (set) early with max beginnings at second hour >= 1 and generating on a locked file.
	- Increased maximum number of teachers, subjects, rooms and buildings to 6000 (they were 3000 previously).
	- Corrected some HTML minor problems, by Volker Dirr.
	- Added a new sample file, by Chafik Graiguer (from Morocco). This user also describes tricks to use official FET for Moroccan schools.
 5.13.0
	- Updated to Qt 4.6.2.
	- For constraints students (set) min hours daily is now possible to allow empty days (in advanced usage) - suggested by Horatiu Halmajan and Catalin Maican.
	- Added a simple activity planning form, by Volker Dirr (see Advanced menu).
	- Now it is allowed to have 3 constraints of type interval max days per week for each students subgroup or teacher (it was maximum 2 previously).
	- Added export of active activities, by Volker Dirr.
	- Added Brazilian Portuguese translation (partial, incomplete yet), by Werner Bruns and Frank Martin.
	- Added Danish translation (partial, only the main form and a few other forms), by David Lamhauge.
	- Improved a bit the memory consumption.
	- The tables contain now an -x- (lowercase) if the teacher/students set/room is not available and -X- (uppercase) for a break (suggested by George Miliotis).
	Also, you can configure separately if you want breaks displayed and/or not available displayed.
	- Removed some useless messages, improving speed for some rare cases under GNU/Linux operating system and similar.
	- Added a few new sample files (by Christoph Schilling, Horatiu Halmajan and aliponte).
	- Changed default language/locale to en_US (instead of en_GB).
 5.12.3
	- Crash bug fix for a rare situation, in which you have constraints (sub)activities preferred starting times or time slots and they refer to no activity (reported by George Miliotis).
 5.12.2
	- Updated to Qt 4.6.1 .
	- Minor interface improvement: since a person reported he accidentally removed the basic constraints, it was added additional user confirmation for this, and more user information.
	- Corrected a possible compiling crash bug under MinGW (this is not a FET bug, it is a MinGW bug). It was made a hack to overpass this bug.
	- Improved export of timetable as CSV, by adding the id-s of the activities (suggested by m).
 5.12.1
	- Added Ukrainian translation (by Andriy Melnyk).
	- Bug fix: when modifying the number of students in a students set, the related activities will show the correct number of students, but the generation
	will consider the old number of students until the user saves and loads again the file.
	- Bug fix when adding/modifying a group's/subgroup's number of students, now all groups/subgroups with same name will have the same (new) number of students.
	- Improved speed of loading for large files and blocked user input while loading a larger file, because otherwise the user could obtain an incomplete file
	(minor bug reported by Volker Dirr).
	- Minor interface improvement: when exiting FET and choosing Save file, if you press Cancel, FET will not exit anymore - reported by Soyeb Aswat
	- Minor interface improvement: added a shortcut button to advanced functions in Time shortcuts section.
	- Minor leak fixed (when removing a group or subgroup).
	- Other minor bug fixes, when removing a group or a year.
 5.12.0
	- Added shortcut buttons on the main form (suggested by more users, especially: daviodan, Massimo Mancini, Paolo Cataldi). They can be deactivated from Settings - Interface menu.
	- Increased max activities to 15,000, max days per 'week' to 35, and other limits, and improved memory management. Now you don't need to have much virtual memory and memory usage is lower.
	This better memory management may bring a small slowdown of the generation, although in rare cases the new version may be faster. Speed variation depends also on the platform.
	More details about the possible slowdown: I compared times by starting parallel generations with the same random seed, which produces the same timetables in identical steps.
	I noticed usually less than 10% increased generating time, but in rare cases for some unusual files a bit more, maximum 17%.
	From the official examples, the worst situation is for the file Hungary/Bethlen/2007-2008-difficult/Bethlen_2007_2008.fet, with about 17% slowdown from FET version 5.11.0 to FET 5.12.0.
	I apologise for this "downgrade" of speed, but it is necessary.
	- Updated to Qt 4.6.0
	- Improved add activity dialog, by Volker Dirr: if in activities dialog, you select a filter and then try to add an activity, the values in this filter
	will be selected in the add activity dialog (this was also suggested by daviodan).
	- Minor interface improvements.
	- Changed help management (added links to online help).
	- Corrected/updated translations.
	- Code cleanup.
 5.11.0
	- Updated to Qt 4.5.2
	- Converted all dialogs to Qt 4 Designer files - suggested by George Miliotis.
	Compilation time is now shorter and intermediary and executable files are smaller.
	- Added constraint teacher(s) min days per week (suggested by several users).
	- Added constraint teacher(s) or students (set) activity tag maximum hours daily (suggested by several users).
	It is not perfect and must be enabled from settings menu.
	- Added constraint students (set) max gaps per day. It is not perfect and must be enabled from settings menu.
	- Very rare crash bug fix (reported by Marco Barsotti).
	- Constraint room not available times permits now multiple constraints for the same room (so, you can use multiple constraints with
	 different weights and preferences for the same room).
	- In add/modify activity and modify subactivity dialogs, the students are displayed in a tree-like structure (suggested by George Miliotis).
	- In all constraints dialogs, added a nice filter (suggested by daviodan).
	- Changed name of constraint: MinNDaysBetweenActivities becomes MinDaysBetweenActivities.
	- Added a count for activities list and constraints list.
	- The constraints with tables now contain an X (nicer look), also centered nicely, and they have colors (which can be enabled in settings)
	- The timetables view forms now center text in cells.
	- Many other minor interface improvements.
	- Rewritten the Catalan translation by Silvia. It is very complete, check it out.
	- Added a new Greek sample file, by George Miliotis.
	- Updated and improved Persian translation by sally sat.
	- Dropped !DOCTYPE FET tag in the .fet files - following general recommendations, and changed FET tag to fet tag. Of course you can open older files.

	- Added possibility to save the highest stage timetable (suggested by Chafik Graiguer, pinco and Massimo Mancini).
	- Added a new Romanian sample file, by Horatiu Halmajan.
	- Updated translations: Russian, German, Romanian, Italian, Spanish.
	- The timetable view dialogs now have resizeable widgets (you can drag the sections with the mouse) - suggested by Ben Bauer.
 5.10.3
	- Added 2 new constraints: three activities grouped, max days between activities (suggested by Zsolt Udvari).
	- Improved the names of constraints: "2" activities grouped, ordered and consecutive are now "two" activities grouped, ordered and consecutive.
	- Code cleanup.
	- Added a new Italian sample file, by Marco.
 5.10.2
	- Speed improvement if user has constraints activities same starting time, 2 activities consecutive and 2 activities ordered and
	 activities not overlapping (idea and partial code by Volker Dirr). In some cases, the speed improvement is very high. This has to
	 do with the initial ordering of the activities.
	- Other minor speed improvements (idea and partial code by Volker Dirr).
	- Added a Persian manual by Hamed SadeghiNeshat.
 5.10.1
	- Speed improvement if user has constraints activities same starting time. Idea and partial code by Volker Dirr.
	- Added possibility to print activities with same starting time in the html timetables (suggested on the forum, implemented by Volker Dirr).
	- Minor interface improments under GNU/Linux. The combo boxes are now smaller.
	- Modified the main menu arrangement of constraints (suggested by Massimo Mancini).
	- Crash bug fix (very rare, if user pressed cancel immediately after hitting generation start in timetable generate dialog).
	- Added another sample file (by T. Renganathan).
 5.10.0
	- Leaking bugs fixed (closed Qt widgets were not removed).
	- Bug fix in generation algorithm. This bug is not seen in practice, but the code in generate.cpp was incorrect in a minor portion.
	Specifically, it corrected tests done when the user has constraints of type students early max beginnings at second hour,
	without max gaps per week for students, with max or min hours daily for students.
	- Added constraint teachers max days per week (suggested by Marco Barsotti).
	- Made the results directory customizable (user can choose it) - suggested by Massimo Mancini.
	- Fixed a bug: if user deactivated some activities, in some cases he could not generate a timetable (if using preferred times
	for (sub)activities).
	- Added a filter in add and modify dialogs constraints activities not overlapping (suggested by Yush Yuen).
	- Added a new feature in the timetable generate dialog, which allows you to see the time when the highest
	number of activities was placed (suggested by Yush Yuen).
	- Added a Catalan translation of the manual, by Joan de Gracia.
	- Changed the name of the html timetable files.
	- Corrected many translations' layout (by Liviu Lalescu).
	- Added a new test for inconsitency for indirect links between constraints actvities same starting time
	(suggested by Silvia).
	- Minor improvement - in students statistics menu, user can select to view complete structure (duplicates enabled)
	or canonical structure.
	- Interface improvement - dialogs when removing the constraints or adding them are improved, so that they are not
	very large for large constraints.
	- Selection mode in constraints not available and preferred slots is improved - you can click table header
	(suggested by Massimo Mancini).
	- Minor other interface improvements.
	- Export warns if existing files (suggested by Angela).
	- Changed directory of sample inputs to 'examples'.
	- Added a 'Related' checkbox in activities and subactivities dialogs (suggested by Bingen).
	- Speed improvement in some precomputing situations (not in generation).

 5.9.4
	- Added the Russian translation (incomplete) - by Ilya V. Paramonov
	- Added the Persian translation (incomplete) - by Hamed SadeghiNeshat
	- Minor bug fix by Volker Dirr - highlighting the same teacher or student set, for html level >= 5, did not work
	correctly for advanced statistics export.
	- Improved compilation time and memory consumption by modifying the data reading and parsing routines
	(additional checking/tests needed here).
	- Minor memory leak fix (normally, not noticeable).
	- Minor interface bug fix (description of constraint teacher max gaps per day displayed incorrectly information about the
	gaps, writing "per week" instead of "per day").
	- Modified the order of search for translation files (firstly in current directory, then in current directory/translations,
	then, under systems which support it, in /usr/share/fet/translations).
 5.9.3
	- Added constraint activity tag preferred room(s) - suggested by Horatiu Halmajan and Catalin Maican
 5.9.2
	- Crash bug fix when importing activities (reported by Thomas Schwartz).
	- Improvements and corrections in the import filter.
 5.9.1
	- Improved a situation for fixed timetables which were impossible sometimes (reported by Horatiu Halmajan). This bug is
	not entirely fixed.

	- Crash bug fix for constraint min gaps between activities with weight below 100%.
	- Bug fix in students early constraint - not critical bug.
	- Updates in Arabic translation.
 5.9.0
	- Added multiple activity tags for a single activity.
	- It is now possible to edit a single subactivity.
	- Added constraints teacher(s) or students (set) activity tag max hours continuously (to specify that
	a teacher or a students set must have maximum n hours continuously for an activity tag) - suggested by Silver,
	George Miliotis and Volker Dirr.
	- Improved a bit the memory consumption.
	- To avoid problems with very large filenames, the sample file names were shortened.
	- Minor html timetables corrections (cosmetic).
	- Updates in Spanish, Arabic, Romanian and Italian translations.
	- Minor improvements.
 5.8.1
	- Minor improvements (code cleanup) - modified a bit the xml files to contain for boolean variables only true/false values
	instead of yes/no (following xml format recommendations).
	- Minor improvement: the constraint activity preferred starting time must have now the day and the hour both specified,
	so there is a clearer distinction between preferred starting time and preferred starting times.
	- Minor improvement - when reading some kind of invalid data, instead of crashing, now FET reports the error
	(like for instance duplicate teachers, or subjects, or wrong tags).
	- Minor improvements in the Italian, Arabic and Spanish translations.
	- Added a sample file from Azu Boba.
	- The index.html links now open in the same window (suggested by daviodan).

	(suggested by Azu Boba, implemented by Liviu Lalescu and Volker Dirr).
	- Added the possibility to lock/unlock the activities which end students day
	(suggested by Volker Dirr, implemented by Liviu Lalescu).
	- The constraints activity preferred starting time and activity preferred room have now an attribute, which
	can mean that some constraints are added permanently by the human operator and cannot be unlocked from the view timetable
	form (suggested by Azu Boba, done by Liviu Lalescu and Volker Dirr).
	- Minor bug fixes (very rare crashes).
	- Minor improvements - when viewing the timetable, the detailed activity view is updated correctly
	(suggested by Jose Cesar Fernandez Lopez).
	- Other minor interface improvements.
	- Minor improvements.
	- Repaired the Turkish translation (by Liviu Lalescu), but it is still old and incomplete.
	- Added the output of activities timetable as xml
 5.7.7
	- Minor improvements (the settings are now saved in a file which does not contain spaces under GNU/Linux,
	other improvements).
 5.7.6
	- Minor interface improvements
	(Command line version now has the parameter "htmllevel", the old one was
	"timetablehtmllevel", which still works. Added description in the README file of the default values.
	Other interface improvements).
 5.7.5
	- Added constraint 2 activities grouped, which is the non-oriented version of constraint 2 activities consecutive
	(the activities can be placed in any order, but one near the other) (suggested by sherman)
	- Added an additional test to ensure that constraints same starting time are not impossible
	- Very minor bug fixes (when working with redundant constraints same starting time/day/hour). This bug
	is most probably unnoticed.
	- Added an additional sample file by Zsolt Udvari (Bethlen, Hungary).
 5.7.4
	- Minor bug fix - if searching for updates at startup is enabled, it gave segmentation fault when exiting FET, under GNU/Linux.

	- Switched to Qt 4.4.3
	- Added a user's manual by Volker Dirr
	- Spanish translation update by Jose Cesar Fernandez Lopez
	- Added an additional sample file by Horatiu Halmajan (Faculty of Economics, Timisoara, Romania)
 5.7.3
	- Modified a bit the spreading activities dialog, now the activities split into 2 and 3 not in consecutive days
	is by default NOT checked, because this might lead to impossible timetables for difficult files. If you want
	spreading for these activities, you need to manually select this option.
	- Arabic translation update by Silver
 5.7.2
	- Added 2 more samples by Cristian Balint
	- Small bug fix in statistics exported as html, by Volker Dirr

	- Minor interface improvement (in report duplicate activities routine)
	- Added status bar for File -> new, open, save and save as menus
 5.6.4
	- Improved Arabic, Lithuanian and Italian translations.
	- Improved a very very rare situation (raised the maximum number of retries for a single activity from 100,000 to 200,000.
	This way, some saved timetables which contain constraints with weights close to 100% and below 100% (like 99.995%) are possible.
	Probably this situation is unnoticed by anybody). The possible problem is not perfectly solved, but it is a compromise.
	- Added possibility to mark or not -x- in the not available slots in timetables (suggested by Silvia, done by Volker Dirr).
	- Added all activities timetables by Volker Dirr (suggested by kdsayang)
	- Added exporting of timetable in csv form by Volker Dirr
 5.6.3
	- Crash bug fix (probably rare)

	(suggested by George Miliotis), added by Volker Dirr.
	- Added Lithuanian translation by Darius Staigys (incomplete yet).
 5.6.2
	- Added constraint teacher(s) and students (set) interval max days per week, to specify an hourly interval
	and the maximum number of days per week for teachers (students) to work in this interval (suggested by Silver).
	This constraint is very useful, for instance specify that teachers and students must not work more than 2
	times per week in the last hour of the day.
	- Added constraint a set of activities end students day - to specify for a group of activities that they
	should end the day for students (for instance for meetings with the class master) - suggested by Zsolt Udvari.
	- Bug fix - when modifying a constraints (sub)activities preferred starting times or time slots, the activity tag
	is now correctly updated.
 5.6.1
	- Crash bug fix (probably very rare).
	- Added possibility to change easier more constraints min n days between activities
	- Added constraints subactivities preferred time slots and subactivities preferred starting times
	(suggested by Volker Dirr). You can specify the component number for subactivities, useful for constraining courses,
	say only the first or the last components of a split activity to be placed earlier.
	- Switched to Qt 4.4.0 and gcc 4.3.1
	- Indonesian, Romanian, Italian, German translations updates.
 5.6.0
	- Added import/export CSV (text with comma separated values) filters by Volker Dirr.
	- Added constraint min gaps between activities (suggested by several users).
	- Add activity dialog, checking/unchecking show years/groups/subgroups does not erase inserted sets (suggested by Zsolt Udvari).
	- Small bug fix when importing activities, consecutive if same day is not correctly imported (reported by daviodan).
	- Added Romanian help for export/import by daviodan.
 5.5.9
	- Added constraint activity(ies) preferred STARTING times, the old preferred times constraints are renamed preferred time slots
	and are more correct now, taking into consideration the duration of each activity (reported by Volker Dirr).
	- Allowing more constraint activity preferred starting times (or preferred time slots) for same activity id,
	which was restricted by a bug to only one. You can add more constraints with different weights.
 5.5.8
	- Bug fix - when saving a timetable, regenerating it might give an impossible timetable - reported by Yush Yuen.
	This bug solved other possible important bug (I doubt someone observed this bug. What happens: if an
	activity has a fixed time, then when FET allocates it it fixes a room for this activity and consequent
	changes are not possible to reschedule this activity to another room - might give impossible timetable in extreme cases).
	Now it is possible to reallocate the room to another slot.
	- Improved add activity dialog - if min days is x (greater than 1) and weight is lower than 100.0%, user can add
	a second constraint with x-1 min days, to ensure activities are better separated.
	- Added advice to remove redundant min n days constraints when adding same starting time constraints.
	- Added another sample by Yush Yuen.
 5.5.7
	- Added 2 samples from Namibia (by Bobby Wise).
	- Added 1 sample from Namibia (by Willy Henckert).
	- Arabic and Greek translations updates.
	- Bug fix - now inactivating some activities allows to generate the timetable, because constraints referring to
	these activities are ignored (suggested by Yush Yuen).
	- Improvement - activating/deactivating activities for a year/group considers also the activities of included groups/subgroups
	(suggested by Yush Yuen).
 5.5.6
	- Arabic, Romanian, Spanish, Italian translations update.
	- Added an option to select all slots available or not available for constraints break, not available and preferred times
	(suggested by didit).
	- Added another Arabic sample by Silver
 5.5.5
	- Very small bug fix (very unlikely to happen, also the effect is almost null)
	- Indonesian, Spanish and Arabic translation updates
	- Added an additional check for inconsistency
 5.5.4
	- Greek, Romanian, Spanish translations updates
	- Small interface improvements
	- Added constraint 2 activities ordered, to allow to say: activity A2 must be after A1, separated
	by any number of days or hours (suggested by kdsayang)
	- Added constraint teacher(s) max hours continuously (suggested by kdsayang)
	- Added constraint students (set) max hours continuously (suggested by kdsayang)
	- When modifying a constraint min n days between activities, it checks for duplicates (suggested by kdsayang)
	- Crash bug fix (rare, if using home rooms with weight under 100% and rooms are constrained)
	- Added more tests to ensure home rooms inputted correctly
	- Generating multiple now saves each timetable in .fet form (suggested by kdsayang)
	- Increased number of days per week to 28, to allow exam scheduling (suggested by kdsayang)
 5.5.3
	- Crash bug fix - when adding a year with same name as a group or subgroup (reported by Volker Dirr)

	- Updated German and Indonesian translation.
	- Possibility to save current timetable in .fet form, with activities locked on their places
	(suggested by Horatiu Halmajan)

	subject or same subject+activity tag) - suggested by Volker Dirr.
	- Improved Romanian translation.
	- Small improvements in the interface.
 5.5.0
	- Modified the algorithm (better or (hopefully not) worse)
	- Command line FET

 5.4.10
	- Improvement in generation, now retrying 100,000 times before giving up for a specific activity,
	works even if activity has preferred times with high weight on impossible slots

This is FET version 7.5.5


Program description:

	FET is free timetabling software (licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3).
	This program aims to automatically generate the timetable of a school, high-school or university.
	It can be used for other timetabling purposes.

	FET can mean "Free Educational Timetabling" (the "E" in the middle may also stand for other words, based on your personal preference).

	FET homepage: https://lalescu.ro/liviu/fet/


Requirements:

	FET is created in the following environment: openSUSE Tumbleweed GNU/Linux distribution, Linux 6.17.5, Xfce 4.20,
	Xfce Terminal Emulator 1.1.5, Midnight Commander 4.8.33, Krusader 2.9.0, Kate 25.08.1, KDiff3 0.9.99-beta, grep 3.12, sed 4.9,
	Thunar Bulk Rename 4.20.4, Qt 6.10.0, QMake 3.1, CMake 4.1.2, Ninja 1.13.0, Qt Creator 18.0.0, GCC 15.2.1, Clang 21.1.4,
	GNU Make 4.4.1, GDB 16.3, Valgrind 3.25.1, Coverity Scan 2024.12.1, Cppcheck 2.15, SpeedCrunch 0.12, QCAD Community Edition 3.26.0.0,
	Inkscape 1.4.2, GIMP 3.0.6, ImageMagick 7.1.2-8, International Ispell 3.1.20 / Aspell 0.60.8.1, tar 1.35, Gzip 1.14, bzip2 1.0.8,
	other great software (most of these software packages are free software, in the sense defined by The Free Software Foundation).

	The executable version of FET for Windows is obtained in the following environment: Windows 11 operating system,
	Command Prompt, Total Commander 11.56, Notepad, Python 3.9.7, ActivePerl 5.28, CMake 3.30.5, Ninja 1.12.1, Qt 6.10.0,
	QMake 3.1, Qt Creator 18.0.0, MinGW 13.1.0, Microsoft Visual C++ 2019, 7-Zip 25.01.

	The executable version of FET for GNU/Linux is obtained in the following environment: GNU/Linux Mint 21.3 "Virginia" Xfce Edition
	with the standard packages, Qt 6.10.0, linuxdeploy 1-alpha (most of these software packages are free software, in the sense defined
	by The Free Software Foundation).

	FET is a C++ application and uses Qt, a C++ toolkit for cross-platform application development.
	FET can be run on any platform supported by Qt (GNU/Linux, Windows, macOS, and maybe others).

	You will need a C++17 compliant C++ compiler to compile FET.

	GNU/Linux, macOS:
	For running, you need only the archive of FET compiled for your operating system (which contains the necessary libraries).
	For compiling, you will need this software:
		Make 4.2.1 or similar (GNU Make).
		GCC 15.2.1 or similar.
		Qt 6.10.0 or compatible. Qt 5.15 or later should be fine.
		QMake 3.1 or compatible (usually available with Qt).

		Note: You need a C++17 compliant C++ compiler. You might be able to use the Clang C++ compiler or other C++ compiler instead of GCC.

		Note2: Starting with Qt 6.5, a new dependency under GNU/Linux might cause problems: if you get an error like:
		"qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb" in "" even though it was found.
		This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.
		Available platform plugins are: eglfs, wayland-egl, vkkhrdisplay, xcb, offscreen, vnc, minimalegl, linuxfb, minimal, wayland.
		Aborted (core dumped),"
		try to install xcb-cursor0 or libxcb-cursor0.

	Windows:
	For running, you need only the archive of FET compiled for Windows (which contains the necessary dll-s).
	For compiling, you need Qt and a compatible C++ compiler complying with the C++17 standard (MinGW is a possibility).


Download:

	You can download the latest version from the FET homepage, https://lalescu.ro/liviu/fet/


Getting - compiling - installing the GNU tools: Make and GCC:

	GNU/Linux, maybe macOS: Most probably, your platform has these installed by default or available on the internet
	as precompiled packages. If you don't have them, please install them using YaST (on openSUSE), Adept Manager
	(on Ubuntu) or other package manager.
	To verify that you have the correct packages, write "make --version", "gcc --version" and
	"g++ --version".
	Advice from a user on Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install build-essential" installs build libraries commonly used.

	Maybe macOS (from the user Darren McDonald): Install Xcode (the current version is 12.5.1) from the Mac App Store. (Once installed, you'll
	need to open the Xcode app to finish the installation.)

	Windows: you need a Qt compatible C++ compiler.
	Maybe an easy option is the MinGW compiler, available optionally with the Qt distribution or on the Qt download page.
	(You might also download MinGW from the internet. There might be more variants. One of them is on: https://www.mingw-w64.org/)


Getting - compiling - installing Qt:

	Qt homepage: https://www.qt.io/

	You will need Qt 6.10.0 or compatible to compile FET. Qt 5.15 or later should be fine.
	You can get the corresponding version of Qt with your package manager or from the internet (preferably from the Qt homepage).
	Qt can be used with the GNU (L)GPL or commercial license (The authors chose the GNU (L)GPL license).

	GNU/Linux: It is possible to use YaST (or Adept Manager) or other package managers to get your version of Qt, pre-compiled.
	Or you can download, (possibly) compile and install Qt from the internet (preferably from its homepage).

	Windows - Download latest Qt from the internet (preferably from its homepage). In the latest precompiled Qt versions the "-schannel" option is
	enabled by default, so there is no need to compile Qt. But in case there is such need, these are the instructions:
	To compile Qt from the sources using the additional configure option "-schannel" (this is done to ensure that SSL will work in FET using the
	available SSL dll-s from Windows): You can choose to download/compile/install only the qtbase component, with a configure command which might look like:
	"configure.bat -opensource -confirm-license -platform win32-g++ -schannel -opengl desktop -release -nomake examples -nomake tests -prefix C:\Qt\6.10.0".
	(When we tried to use the recommended option "-opengl dynamic" we got a compiler error.)
	Note that to be able to open ui files with Qt Designer or ts files with Qt Linguist you need to install the Qt component qttools
	(or the whole Qt package).

	macOS:
	Install Qt (the current version is 6.10.0) from https://www.qt.io. The default install location is /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Qt, and you can create
	a (free) Qt account. [Update: if you're just using Qt for FET, you should select to "download for open source".]

	Note about the Qt "QMAKESPEC" variable: advanced topic, read this if you get Qt errors about the environment not being set, or environment
	variable QMAKESPEC not being set, or if the Qt environment is not set correctly: Qt needs to know the environment you are using. It is usually
	something like: linux-g++, macx-g++ or win32-g++ (platform-compiler). You can find all the supported platforms in the directory "mkspecs" of Qt
	(some usual locations are /usr/share/qt5/mkspecs or /usr/lib/qt5/mkspecs on GNU/Linux or C:\Qt\6.10.0\mkspecs on Windows).
	It seems that Qt automatically finds the platform (there is a default configuration in the "default" subdirectory of the "mkspecs" directory,
	which is created automatically when you install Qt). If the default configuration is not working or is wrong, you may need to set the
	correct QMAKESPEC variable for your platform. Under Windows, you can create an environment variable QMAKESPEC equal to win32-g++
	(if you are using MinGW), under other platforms create an environment variable named QMAKESPEC equal with the correct platform-compiler
	you are working on (for instance macx-g++ or linux-g++).


Compiling FET:

	You will need a C++17 compliant C++ compiler to compile FET.

	Note: if after unpacking the tar.bz2 sources archive you obtain some files with incomplete/truncated file names in the sources directories,
	you might need to use a better (un)packer (probably a recent version of the official tar and bzip2 should be fine).
	For GNU/Linux and maybe macOS, "tar -jxvf fet-v.v.v.tar.bz2" should work correctly.
	For Windows, either use a modern good (un)packer, or, advice from a user:
		1. download mingw-get-setup.exe from https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/
		2. run mingw-get-setup.exe
		3. check msys-base to be installed, Apply Changes from Installation menu and close MinGW Installation Manager
		4. run C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat
		5. $ cd to the directory where the .tar.bz2 file is
		6. $ tar -jxvf fet-v.v.v.bz2

	Note NMkJobs: advice from a user: if you have a multiple core computer, you may be able to split the compilation into more threads, with the -j option for the
	make command, so that the compilation is faster. This option creates a number of compilation threads equal to the number specified along with the -j option.
	Under GNU/Linux or macOS, just write "make -j 16" if you have a 16 threads computer. This is proven to work under GNU/Linux and macOS. Under Windows it depends
	on the C++ compiler (you may try it to see if it works) - with MinGW it works.

	Note: if you had a wrongly setup environment and you updated it, before the new compilation you might want to remove all the previously generated temporary
	files, like the Makefile-s and the generated files in the tmp directory. Under GNU/Linux, this can be done with a "make distclean", but it is maybe the best
	idea to remove everything and unpack again the FET sources.

	Currently FET can be compiled with a C++ compiler, using Qt version 6.10.0 or compatible.

	Note NUseSystemLocale: If you want FET to autodetect the system locale language, type <<qmake fet.pro "DEFINES+=USE_SYSTEM_LOCALE">>
	or simply <<qmake "DEFINES+=USE_SYSTEM_LOCALE">>. This will work if you recompile from the beginning all the FET package (remove
	all the intermediary files and recompile), and also if you did not use FET on this machine or if you remove the settings file/registry entry for FET
	(otherwise FET will retain the language which was already saved in its settings).
	
	Note GL: If you get an error like this:
	In file included from ../../Qt5.3.2/5.3/gcc_64/include/QtGui/qopenglcontext.h:62:0,
		from ../../Qt5.3.2/5.3/gcc_64/include/QtGui/QtGui:32,
		from ../../Qt5.3.2/5.3/gcc_64/include/QtWidgets/QtWidgetsDepends:3,
		from ../../Qt5.3.2/5.3/gcc_64/include/QtWidgets/QtWidgets:3,
		from engine/import.cpp:35:
	../../Qt5.3.2/5.3/gcc_64/include/QtGui/qopengl.h:110:21: fatal error: GL/gl.h: No such file or directory
	 #  include <GL/gl.h>
					^
	compilation terminated.
	you may need to install additional packages before compiling FET. For instance, on openSUSE GNU/Linux you may need to install Mesa-devel
	(or maybe only Mesa-libGL-devel); on Mint GNU/Linux you may need to install libgl1-mesa-dev.

	Note: If you want to compile only the command-line version, open the file fet.pro with a text editor and from the second line remove the
	text "src/src.pro ".


	GNU/Linux:
	- You will need Qt 6.10.0 or compatible to compile this program.
	- type "qmake fet.pro" or simply "qmake". You have to use QMake from Qt 6 series (this command is executed very fast, so don't worry if you
		get immediate return from it)
	See also notes NUseSystemLocale and Note4 above.
	- type "make" (this takes some time). See also note NMkJobs above ("make -j 16" for instance will be much faster on a 16 threads processor).
	The exact measured time to compile FET-6.28.0: 3 minutes 20 seconds on 16 threads (make -j 16) on a Ryzen 7 2700X.
	To remove the compiled objects/executable: "make clean" and/or "make distclean".


	macOS:
	3 Variants:

	1. First variant, if you use the GCC compiler:
	- You will need Qt 6.10.0 or compatible to compile this program.
	- type "qmake fet.pro" or simply "qmake". You have to use QMake from Qt 6 series.
	(this command is executed very fast, so don't worry if you get immediate return from it)
	- IMPORTANT: you might need to write: "qmake -spec macx-g++ fet.pro", if "qmake fet.pro"
	does not produce a correct makefile.
	See also notes NUseSystemLocale and Note4 above.
	- type "make" (this takes some time). See also note NMkJobs above ("make -j 16" for instance will be much faster on a 16 threads processor).
	The compilation might take 3-5 minutes on multiple threads on a modern computer.
	To remove the compiled objects/executable: "make clean" and/or "make distclean".

	2. Another variant:
	- Type "qmake fet.pro" and then "xcodebuild".

	3. Another variant, if you use the Clang C++ compiler (which seems to be the default for Qt 6.10.0 on macOS):
	It seems that you need to type:
	/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Qt/6.10.0/macos/bin/qmake -r -spec /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Qt/6.10.0/macos/mkspecs/macx-clang
	(the -r parameter might not be necessary.)

	If you are compiling on a computer with Mac silicon (e.g., an M1 MacBook, etc.) and want to create a version that will run on Intel processors as well,
	instead of the command above, use
	/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Qt/6.10.0/macos/bin/qmake -r -spec /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Qt/6.10.0/macos/mkspecs/macx-clang QMAKE_APPLE_DEVICE_ARCHS="x86_64 arm64"

	Then "make" (this takes some time). See also note NMkJobs above ("make -j 16" for instance will be much faster on a 16 threads processor).
	The compilation might take 3-5 minutes on multiple threads on a modern computer.
	To remove the compiled objects/executable: "make clean" and/or "make distclean".
	Please see: https://lalescu.ro/liviu/fet/forum/index.php?topic=2488.msg13425#msg13425 (and also see the whole topic there.)


	Windows: MinGW C++ compiler: you need Qt 6.10.0 or compatible, and MinGW.
	You might use other C++ compilers if you want, please see the Qt documentation.
	for other variants. Any C++ compiler that supports Qt should be good.
	You need to run "qmake fet.pro" or "qmake" (this command is executed very fast, so don't worry if you get
	immediate return from it) and then, if you are using MinGW, "mingw32-make" (this takes some time)
	in a command line in the FET directory.
	See also note NUseSystemLocale above.
	See also Note GL above.
	See also note NMkJobs above ("mingw32-make -j 16" for instance will be much faster on a 16 threads processor).
	The exact measured time to compile FET-6.28.0: 4 minutes 30 seconds on 16 threads (mingw-make -j 16) on a Ryzen 7 2700X.
	(You can use the command line prompt of Windows or the Qt command line prompt shortcut in the Qt shortcuts menu.)
	Then, you can remove the directories "src" and "tmp", to save up space, if you want.
	You will need to copy the dll-s in the same directories as in the official FET archive for Windows.


Installing FET:

	GNU/Linux, and maybe macOS:
	Type "make install" with root permissions.
	
	GNU/Linux: to associate the *.fet files with the FET executable and to make them display the FET icon in the file browser, after "make install",
	you might need to write these three commands (again, with root permissions):
		xdg-icon-resource forceupdate --theme hicolor
		update-mime-database /usr/share/mime
		update-desktop-database
	
	GNU/Linux: How to obtain a universally running file using linuxdeploy:
	
	Download these 3 linuxdeploy packages (the authors use the x86_64 executable packages, which are for 64-bit systems):
		https://github.com/linuxdeploy/linuxdeploy/releases/tag/continuous
		https://github.com/linuxdeploy/linuxdeploy-plugin-qt/releases/tag/continuous
		https://github.com/linuxdeploy/linuxdeploy-plugin-appimage/releases/tag/continuous
	
	Assuming you work from the command line, set these environment variables:
		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/Qt/6.10.0/gcc_64/lib
		export QMAKE=/home/user/Qt/6.10.0/gcc_64/bin/qmake
	
	Assuming you compiled FET and that you copied the whole directory to /home/user/fet-appdir/ and to /home/user/fet-appimage/ :
	
	AppDir:
		./linuxdeploy-x86_64.AppImage --appdir /home/user/fet-appdir/fet-v.v.v/ -e /home/user/fet-appdir/fet-v.v.v/fet
			-d /home/user/fet-appdir/fet-v.v.v/fet.desktop -i /home/user/fet-appdir/fet-v.v.v/icons/256x256/fet.png --plugin qt
		also for fet-cl, without -d and -i.
		Copy/move the translations directory near the executables, in the directory /home/user/fet-appdir/fet-v.v.v/AppDir/usr/bin.
	
	AppImage:
		make install INSTALL_ROOT=AppDir
		Create the directory /home/user/fet-appimage/fet-v.v.v/AppDir/usr/bin if it does not exist.
		Copy/move the fet executable to /home/user/fet-appimage/fet-v.v.v/AppDir/usr/bin/fet.
		Copy/move the translations directory near the executable, in the directory /home/user/fet-appimage/fet-v.v.v/AppDir/usr/bin.
		./linuxdeploy-x86_64.AppImage --appdir /home/user/fet-appimage/fet-v.v.v/AppDir/ -e /home/user/fet-appimage/fet-v.v.v/AppDir/usr/bin/fet
			-d /home/user/fet-appimage/fet-v.v.v/AppDir/usr/share/applications/fet.desktop
			-i /home/user/fet-appimage/fet-v.v.v/AppDir/usr/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/fet.png
			--plugin qt --output appimage
	
	macOS: The user Darren McDonald reported that one can obtain a universal macOS executable with:
	cd /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Qt/6.10.0/macos/bin/
	./macdeployqt /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Downloads/fet-v.v.v/fet.app
	
	Windows:
	Move the FET directory to a place of your choice.


Running FET:
	Note: The FET main window contains a menu with the items: File, Data, History, Statistics, Advanced,
	Timetable, Settings, Help. Everything is right if you have that. Optionally, on the main window there may be a toolbox
	containing shortcuts (if selected by the user in the settings. By default it is selected).
	
	To run FET in interface mode, you just need to run the executable named fet or fet.exe. You can also open directly a fet data file, by giving it
	as a unique argument to the FET executable: "fet filename.fet" (or, on Windows, "fet.exe filename.fet").

	GNU/Linux, and maybe macOS:
	- If you installed FET with "make install":
		Run the FET executable from the directory /usr/bin/ (it should be /usr/bin/fet for the interface version or /usr/bin/fet-cl for command line),
		or use the FET shortcut (/usr/share/applications/fet.desktop).
	- If you did not install FET with "make install":
		chdir to the directory where the fet executable is (for instance, "cd ~/fet-v.v.v/") and run it with "./fet" or with the suitable command
		for your platform. Alternatively, you may run the executable named fet from the fet-v.v.v directory, using another method. The fet executable
		will be located inside the fet-v.v.v directory after a successful compilation.
	You can give the fet executable a data file to be loaded on startup: "fet filename.fet" or "./fet filename.fet".

	Note2: Starting with Qt 6.5, a new dependency under GNU/Linux might pose problems: if you get an error like:
	"qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb" in "" even though it was found.
	This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.
	Available platform plugins are: eglfs, wayland-egl, vkkhrdisplay, xcb, offscreen, vnc, minimalegl, linuxfb, minimal, wayland.
	Aborted (core dumped)",
	try to install xcb-cursor0 or libxcb-cursor0.

	Note for macOS about using translations: If you want to use FET in a language other than the default, you'll need to move the translation files
	into the appropriate location. The files you need to move can be found in /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Downloads/fet-v.v.v/translations. You'll want to
	move all of the files ending with .qm to a new location. Open a new Finder window and right-click on the FET.app you've just created in
	/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Downloads, and select Show Package Contents. Then open the Contents folder, and finally open the MacOS folder within Contents.
	This is where you should move the .qm files. Once these have been moved, you switch FET languages within the FET app as usual.

	Windows:
	Run the fet.exe executable (its location is inside the fet-v.v.v directory, you can find it there if you have FET precompiled for Windows or after you compiled it).
	You can give this executable a data file to be loaded on startup: "fet.exe filename.fet".

	Command line version usage: fet-cl --inputfile=FILE [options]

			fixed in time, but are fixed in space in a virtual room, specifying also the real rooms (which is not recommended) (default true).

		--warnifusingmaxhoursdailywithlessthan100percentweight=WMHDWLT100PW
			WMHDWLT100PW is either true or false, represents whether you want the program to issue a warning if you are using constraints of type
			teacher(s)/students (set) max hours daily with a weight less than 100% (default true).

		--verbose=VBS
			VBS is either true or false, represents whether you want additional generation messages and other messages to be shown on the command
			line (default false).

	Run "fet-cl --help" to get usage information.

	Run "fet-cl --version" to get version information.

	You can ask the FET command line process to stop the timetable generation, by sending it the SIGTERM (or SIGBREAK, on Windows) signal. FET will then
	write the current timetable and the highest stage timetable and exit. (If you send the FET command line the SIGINT signal it will stop immediately,
	without writing the timetable.)

	If you create a file named exactly 'sigwrite' in the root output directory, the program will output the current and the highest stage timetables
	without stopping the generation (a poll for the existence of this file is done once every second), and then remove this file.

	The potential warnings are logged in the file outputdir/logs/warnings.txt, and the potential errors are logged in the file outputdir/logs/errors.txt.

	The result of the operation is logged in the file outputdir/logs/result.txt.

	Also, you have in logs the initial order of activities and a list of maximum placed number of activities. If your timetable is impossible, say it stops
	at maximum n placed activities, look at the n+1-st activity in the initial order, for it or its students/teachers may be the problem.

	For the command line version, probably the most useful output to use internally in an application might be the activities_timetable.xml.
	You have of course also the xml timetables for students and teachers and the nicely formatted HTML timetables to present directly.

	You'll get a console output to help you with data, along with the files in the directory outputdir/logs/.
	
	If you are a programmer, in the file src/engine/messageboxes.cpp you'll find the implementation of the various messages. You
	can modify these functions, catching them in your program. Also, you can catch the end of the program (successful or unsuccessful) in
	the file src/interface/fet.cpp, in the command-line code part.
	
	If you want to be completely independent from Qt, using only standard C++, you can remove all the Qt includes and
	reimplement the used Qt classes QString, QList, QSet, QHash, and maybe others (only the member functions which are necessary). Or just get
	the corresponding code from Qt (Please review the Qt licensing options, in this case. Currently, they include GNU (L)GPL and commercial).
	The program should have independence of a particular implementation of QSet and QHash so, if you reimplement these two containers,
	any order of elements should lead to the same generation results. Contrary behavior should be reported as a bug.


Languages (translations):

	The translation files which the FET executable needs in order to be able to run in other languages are ending in .qm (like fet_**.qm)
	and they are located in the "translations" directory in the FET distribution.

	FET will search for translations (fet_**.qm files) in the following order:
	1) directly in the directory where the fet executable is,
	2) the directory "translations" in the directory where fet executable is,
	3) the directory /usr/share/fet/translations (under GNU/Linux or macOS).

	So, on:
	Windows: if fet.exe is in C:\fet-v.v.v, fet will search for the file fet_**.qm in
		C:\fet-v.v.v and then in C:\fet-v.v.v\translations
	GNU/Linux: if the fet executable is in ~/fet-v.v.v, fet will search for the file fet_**.qm in
		~/fet-v.v.v, then in ~/fet-v.v.v/translations and then in /usr/share/fet/translations
	macOS: the operation is approximately similar to the one for GNU/Linux.
		The difference is that it seems that the fet application on macOS contains in turn other directories (application directories),
		so FET will search for the translations inside these application directories, not in the fet-v.v.v directory. The GNU/Linux style fet executable
		seems to be located in fet-v.v.v/fet.app/Contents/MacOS, so FET will search for the file fet_**.qm in the directory
		fet-v.v.v/fet.app/Contents/MacOS, then in the directory fet-v.v.v/fet.app/Contents/MacOS/translations,
		then in the directory /usr/share/fet/translations.
		Please see also the macOS note from the section "Running FET".
		More notes for the macOS platform, from a user: copying the translations/ directory into the directory fet.app/Contents/MacOS/ is
		possible from the command line in X11 xterm (but it is not possible with the finder program, because the file extension ".app" is
		exclusive for applications, so the program finder interprets a directory with the extension ".app" as an application).

	What to do if you get stuck with an unknown language: in each language, the submenu (Settings->)Language is translated also in English
		(like: Limba/Language in Romanian). You can select the US English language (en_US abbreviation) and then close and restart FET (press the middle button
		from the dialog that appears after trying to close FET, so that FET will exit without saving the current file).
	Another solution: modify the FET settings on your operating system:
		- Under GNU/Linux, and maybe macOS, usually in your $HOME/.config directory you'll find a directory "fet",
		containing file "fettimetabling.conf". Edit that file - the line beginning with language, instead of language=... (for instance, language=ro),
		make it language=en_US (case sensitive).
		- Under Windows: run regedit.exe (Registry Editor), search key "fet". You will find a "fet" section with "fettimetabling" subsection.
		Modify the value name language (from, for instance, ro, or other language) to have the value data en_US (5 characters, case sensitive).
	Another solution: simply remove the translation files (or move them so they are not available to the fet executable) and start FET. It will report
		that the custom language is not found and it will revert to en_US.


Documentation:

	Some hints in the directory "fet-v.v.v/doc/" (under GNU/Linux or macOS, they may be found in usr/share/doc/fet/ directory).
	Some other hints in the program Help menu.
	You may find more documentation on the FET homepage.


Input files:

	You can open a few sample input files in the "fet-v.v.v/examples/" directory
	(under GNU/Linux or macOS, they may be found in /usr/share/fet/examples/)


Uninstalling FET:

	GNU/Linux, and maybe macOS: type "make uninstall" with root permissions. Then,

	GNU/Linux and Windows:
	Remove the directory fet-v.v.v. Also, you may want to remove the directory with the fet results (default: $HOME/fet-results).
	This will leave the settings of FET on your system. FET stores its settings in your operating system's dedicated section.
	If you really want to remove everything that FET created, please read below.

	To completely remove stored FET settings from your operating system:

	GNU/Linux:
	Usually, in your $HOME/.config directory you will find a directory "fet" containing the file "fettimetabling.conf".
	Remove the directory "fet" and its contents.

	macOS: It seems that the configuration file might be: $HOME/Library/Preferences/com.fet.fettimetabling.plist

	Windows:
	Run regedit.exe (Registry Editor), search for the key "fet". You will find a section "fet" with the subsection "fettimetabling".
	Remove the "fet" section and its contents.

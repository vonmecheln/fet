FET (c) 2002-2007 Liviu Lalescu

Program description:
	FET is free timetabling software.
	This program aims to automatically generate the timetable of a school, high-school
	or possibly university,	by a heuristic algorithm. 
	FET can mean "Free Educational Timetabling".
	
Requirements:
	FET is created in the following environment: Kubuntu 7.0.4 GNU/Linux distribution,
	Midnight Commander 4.6.1, Qt 4.3.0, gcc 4.1.2, Linux 2.6.20, other great free tools.
	FET can be run on any platform supported by the free software Qt.
	
	GNU/Linux and similar OS's:
	Software: gcc 4.1.2 or similar, Qt 4.3.0 or compatible.
	
	Mac OS X:
	Mac OS X 10.4.x or compatible.
	Apple's developer tools installed.	
	Qt 4.3.0 or compatible (!!!! NOT Qt 4.2.x)
	
	Microsoft Windows:
	For running, you need only the archive of FET compiled for Windows (which contains
	the MinGW and Qt dlls).

Download:
	You can download the latest version from http://www.lalescu.ro/liviu/fet/ (for now).
	Older versions: you will have to contact the author if you are interested.

Getting - compiling - installing Qt:
	You will need Qt 4.3.0 or compatible to compile FET. You can get your
	corresponding version of Qt from http://www.trolltech.com . Please get
	the opensource version of Qt, which is available for now on
	http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/x11 .
	
	For GNU/Linux - there are instructions in the Qt package on how to install-compile it.
	Basically, type ./configure, make, make install. Then, add or create .profile
	in your home directory, adding or creating the following lines:
	PATH=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.3.0/bin:$PATH
	export PATH
	where x is your corresponding number of the version.
		
	For Windows - Download latest OpenSource Qt for MinGW from 
	http://www.trolltech.com (for now, the page is
	http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/windows )
	Install and let Qt download and install MinGW.
	Please make sure, after installing Qt and MinGW, that you have
	an environment variable named "QTDIR" which is C:\Qt\4.3.0"
	and you have in the PATH environmental variable the contents
	QTDIR and C:\MinGW\bin.
	
	For Mac OS X: 
		- Unverified - you can get the latest version of Qt from trolltech.com and 
	compile it on your operating system.
		- Verified: You can download a binary installer of Qt 4.1.0 
		(compatible with Qt 4.1.2) from: http://naranja.umh.es/~atg/software-qt4.html
		Set the required environment variables for your shell. For tcsh,
		add the following lines to the end of your ~/.tcshrc file:
			setenv QTDIR /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.1.0
			setenv PATH $QTDIR/bin:$PATH
			setenv MANPATH $QTDIR/doc/man
			setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH $QTDIR/lib		

Compiling FET:
	
	First of all, currently FET can be compiled using just Qt 4.3.0 or compatible.
	But the majority of interface files are Qt 3.3 forms and to modify them
	you will need Qt 3.3, which unfortunately has no free Windows version.

	GNU/Linux and similar OS's:
	- You will need Qt 4.3.0 or compatible to compile this program.
	- type "qmake fet.pro".
	- type "make"
	To remove the compiled objects/executable: "make clean" and/or "make distclean".
	
	Mac OS X:
	- You will need Qt 4.3.0 or compatible to compile this program.
	- type "qmake fet.pro".
	- type "make"
	To remove the compiled objects/executable: "make clean" and/or "make distclean".
	
	Microsoft Windows: you will have to download and install Qt from trolltech.com (see above).
	You need to run "qmake" and then "make" in a command line in the FET directory. 
	You will need to move the file fet.exe from the directory "fet-x.x.x\src\" to the "fet-x.x.x\"
	directory (this is a small Qt bug). Then, you can remove directories "src" and "tmp",
	to save up space.
	If you want to obtain a version which can be run on other computers, 
	you have to copy 7 files into the FET directory:
	C:\MinGW\bin\mingwm10.dll, C:\Qt\4.3.0\bin\Qt3Support4.dll,
	C:\Qt\4.3.0\bin\QtCore4.dll, C:\Qt\4.3.0\bin\QtGui4.dll,
	C:\Qt\4.3.0\bin\QtNetwork4.dll, C:\Qt\4.3.0\bin\QtSQl4.dll,
	C:\Qt\4.3.0\bin\QtXml4.dll.
	E-mail author or the mailing list for more details.
	
Installing FET:
	GNU/Linux and similar OS's:	
	Please move the whole directory "fet-x.x.x" into the place where you like,
	for instance to the directory "/usr/local/".
	
	Microsoft Windows:
	Move the FET directory in a place of your choice.

Running FET:
	GNU/Linux and similar OS's:
	Please chdir to the directory where fet executable is (for instance,
	"cd /home/liviu/fet-x.x.x/") and run "./fet".
	Please note that you must be in the FET directory to be able to use
	correctly a translation and for FET to put the results in the correct directory.
	
	Microsoft Windows:
	Run the executable fet.exe
	
Documentation:
	Very primitive: some hints in the directory "/.../fet-x.x.x/doc/".
	Some other hints in Help menu.
	If you are a programmer and would like to know how the program works,
	you can use "doxygen" to generate API documentation.

Input files:
	You can open a few sample input files in "/.../fet-x.x.x/sample_inputs/" directory.
	
	You can create/modify a file from FET's user interface or you can modify it by
	hand, if you like.

Feed-back / help:
	- I would like to hear your oppinions/results about this program; any
	feed-back would be greatly appreciated.
	- Reporting bugs/wishes/patches: for now, to the author.
	
	This project is free software, so any sponsoring offer/donation would be great. You can 
	contact	the author for that.

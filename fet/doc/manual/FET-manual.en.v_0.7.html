    <p>
      FET is free software for automatically scheduling the timetable of a school, high-school or university.
      It uses a fast and efficient timetabling algorithm.
      It is free software, open source, licensed under GNU/GPL.
      Get the latest news and version from the official FET homepage (<a href="http://www.lalescu.ro/liviu/fet/">http://www.lalescu.ro/liviu/fet/</a>).

    <p>
      This is a small manual with hopefully a lot of useful examples.

      Liviu Lalescu (http://www.lalescu.ro/liviu/) started his project at the end of year 2002 as he was working on his diploma.
      He got his examination in computer programming (software specialization) in June 2003.
      FET had a very large palette of constraints,
      but sadly the evolutionary algorithm was only able to solve easy timetables.
      Even great efforts during the following years in research the genetic algorithm was never good enough to solve complex timetables.
      In summer 2007 the big breakthrough was done.
      A new heuristic algorithm (based on recursive swapping of activities) was able to solve difficult timetables in a few minutes.

    <h1 id="id_3">Features</h1>
    <p>
      There are a lot of nice features.
      FET is able to automatically care about all groups (classes/courses/students),
      has a very large palette of constraints and of course nice styleable xhtml timetables.

    <p class="hint">
      FET doesn't have a option to print in this menu.
      The timetables will be written into the results directory after a timetable is generated.
      Please read chapter <a href="#id_43">Print timetables</a> if you want to know how to print a timetable.
    </p>
    <p class="warning">
        Save your dataset regularly. Especially if you add or modify constraints.
        FET doesn't have a undo option right now. Sometimes it's very difficult to undo the last modification.
        Also if FET didn't find a solution after several hours you maybe want to undo but already forgot last changes.

    <p class="definition">
      A Period is a distance in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The periods are printed into the timetable. So use short cuts to get smaller timetables.
      You can use any phrase as period name.
    </p>
    <p class="warning">
      You have to care about that every period has the same distance (is as long as every other period),
      because FET take always duration 1 per period.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
      (Except if you add a period that always get special activities or a break.
      In example 4 a period <em>09.35-10.00</em> can be added and this period always get the constraint break.
      But that is only a cosmetic intrusion.)
    </p>
    <p>
      So by this example an activity with duration 1 take 45 minutes and an activity with duration 2 take 90 minutes.
    </p>
    <p class="warning">
      Activities can not get non-integer duration like 1.5.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
      Your institution has activities with 90 minutes duration on Monday, Wednesday and Friday
      but only 60 minutes duration on Tuesday and Thursday.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Make periods that take 30 minutes.
      So activities that take 60 minutes must get duration 2 and activities that take 90 minutes must get duration 3.
    </div>
    <p class="hint">
      If FET cannot find a solution you should think about increasing the number of periods or the number of days.
      If FET is able to solve your dataset easily and you don't know other constraints to add you should maybe think about decreasing number of periods or number of days.
      But you should rethink about all constraints again!
      (Especially <em>Not available teachers, students or rooms</em> constraints.)

    <h4 id="id_11">*Teachers, subjects, activity tags &amp; rooms</h4>
    <p>
      Add teachers, subject, activity tags, rooms and buildings.
    </p>
    <p class="hint">
      Also these names are printed into the timetable. So use short cuts to get smaller timetables.
    </p>
    <p class="definition" id="id_34">
      A activity tag is an optional information to an activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Activity tags are for example <em>lecture</em> (<em>reading</em>), <em>exercise</em> or <em>laboratory</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If activities with duration 2 must start in odd periods (1st, 3th, 5th, ...) the activity tag might be <em>odd</em>.<br />
      If some activities must (or should) be instructed only in the morning the activity tag might be <em>morning</em>.
    </p>
    <div class="hint">
      Before using activity tags please read whole chapter <a href="#id_16">Constraints</a> and very carefully section <a href="#id_26">preferred time(s)</a>.
    </div>
    <p class="waning">
      Think at least twice before using activity tags. I recommend to use activity tags only to set constraints.
      Try to set constraint as long as (easily) possible without an activity tag.
      Activity tags are very powerful, but every activity has only one tag.
    </p>

    <p>
      You don't need to add home rooms. Normally every group (class or teacher) has it's own home room. 
      There will never be a room conflict if every group has it's own room.
      Add only rooms that could have a conflict (arts room, gym, science lab, ...)
       or if you have more groups than rooms.
    </p>
    <p class="hint">
      Every room has capacity 1. So only one activity can be placed per room.
      If you have a huge gym (that maybe can be separated into 3 parts by curtains),
      then enter 3 rooms for the gym.
    </p>

    <p>
      You don't need to add buildings.
      Add only buildings if you want to use a buildings constraint
       (like <em>Max building changes per day</em> or <em>Min gaps between building changes</em>.)
    </p>
    <p class="warning">
      If you need to add different buildings you also need to care about global clear room names.
      If you have room name 123 in building A, then you can't name a room 123 in building B too.
      So i recommend to include the building name into the room name.
      For example room 123 in building A should get the name A-123.

    <h4 id="id_12">Years, groups and subgroups</h4>
    <p>
      It's very important to understand the difference between years, groups, subgroups, classes, courses, divisions and categories.
      But it's not very easy. Please read definitions and all examples.
    </p>
    <p class="definition">
      Year (form): A set of students at the same stage of their schooling.
      For example a German primary school has years 1 to 4. A year contain (in most cases) several groups (classes).
    </p>
    <p class="definition">
      Group, Class, course and division: A set of students who visit the same activities.
      So they meet the same teachers to study the same subjects at the same time.
    </p>
    <p class="definition">
      Category: A set of groups that might have activities simultaneously.
    </p>
    <div class="definition">
      Class (division of the first category): A set of students who meet (nearly always) the same activities.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      FET avoid using the term class, because this term is used different in colloquial language.
      Depending on the context a students say that he visit <em>class A</em> or <em>class 1</em> or <em>class 1A</em>.
      In this example FET will call <em>1</em> as year, <em>A</em> as division of a category and <em>1A</em> as group.
    </div>

    <h5>Example 1: Primary School</h5>
    <div class="example">
      A German primary school has 4 years.
      But there are different number of groups (classes) (depending on the number of students per year).
      For example Group <em>1A</em>, <em>1B</em>, <em>1C</em>, <em>2A</em>, <em>2B</em>, <em>2C</em>, <em>3A</em>, <em>3B</em>, <em>4A</em>, <em>4B</em>.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      To enter the first year of this example add year <em>1</em>. Then <em>divide year automatically by selecting categories</em>.
      Increase number of divisions up to 3 and call them <em>A</em>, <em>B</em> and <em>C</em> in the first category.
      Now check the groups to see what happen.
      To avoid space between year and category name just remove the space of the <em>separator character(s)</em> in the <em>divide year automatically by selecting categories</em>.
    </div>
    <table class="example" border="1">
      <tr>
        <th>course</th><th>subject (duration)</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="center">Biology<br />Chemistry<br />Physics</td>
      <td align="center">Biology (4), chemistry (1), physics (2)<br />Biology (1), chemistry (4), physics (2)<br />Biology (2), chemistry (1), physics (4)</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p class="definition">
      Course (division of the second category): A set of students who meet (sometimes) the same activities.
    </p>

    <h5>Example 2: Secondary School</h5>
    <div class="example">
      A German secondary school has years from 5 to 10. In every year are again several classes (groups).
      But the students can now choose a course (group category 2).
      So this students visit several same activities (but the number of activities is normally lower then the number of activities of a class)
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
    <img src="pictures/splitting.png" alt="splitting a year" />
      To enter this example add year <em>10</em>. Then <em>divide year automatically by selecting categories</em>.
      Increase number of divisions up to 4 and call them <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em> and <em>D</em> in the first category.
      Increase the Number of categories up to 2 and the number of division of this category up to 3.
      Call them <em>Biology</em>, <em>Chemistry</em> and <em>Physics</em>.
      Now check the subgroups to see what happen.
      The most important is to see that you get the groups
       <em>10A</em>, <em>10B</em>, <em>10C</em>, <em>10D</em>, <em>10Biology</em>, <em>10Chemestry</em> and <em>10Physics</em> by this.
      (So in this example the first 4 groups are classes and the last 3 are courses.
       To FET they are just groups. It doesn't know the duration of the groups (at this moment).
    </div>
    <p class="warning">
      Be careful if you have a (nearly) 100% filled timetable.
      This activities are scheduled simultaneously if the timetable is 100% filled.
      So if you do the activity planing you have to be sure that the timetable is solvable.
      In this example the duration of a course is 4+1+2=7.
      So it's impossible that all physics activities are instructed by the same teacher because physics has total duration 2+2+4=8.
      But if physics in the physics course is instructed by a different teacher then in the other courses, then this courses are possible.
    </p>
    <p class="hint">
      It doesn't matter in this example if the physics course get only biology duration 1.
      FET is able to care about that, even the duration is different between the courses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your can add a second set of courses by using category 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can add a third set of courses by manually doing the same like <em>divide year automatically by selecting categories</em>,
       but it's a little bit tricky. In some cases you don't need to add a new category (read next hint).
    </p>
    <table class="example" border="1">
      <tr>
        <th>course</th><th>subject (duration)</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="center">christian religion<br />jewish religion<br />muslim religion<br />philosophy</td>
      <td align="center">christian religion (2)<br />jewish religion (2)<br />muslim religion (2)<br />philosophy (2)</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <div class="example">
      The students have different religions in the same classes. So they have religion in courses.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      If there is only one subject, then it the easiest (and in (nearly) 100% filled timetables the only possible solution) to scheduled all at the same time.
      There are several possibilities to do it
       (compare <a href="#id_15">Add an activity</a> and constraint <a href="#id_27">A set of activities has same starting time (day+hour)</a>).
      In most cases you just add the subject <em>religion</em>.
      It's clear if the religion is christian, jewish, muslim or philosophy, because you can see this by the teachers name.
    </div>
    <p>
      Think about needed categories first. The first category should always be the class.
      The second and third category should be the categories with the longest total duration.
      Other categories must be done manually or by the hint simultaneous activities.
    </p>
    <p class="warning">
      Maybe you know that (by accident) no students is in Group 10A and 10Bio at the same time.
      You can delete the corresponding subgroups. You maybe get better timetables by this.
      But you need to do it only if your timetable is not 100% filled. Be careful!
      This also mean you (maybe) cannot put a students with group 10Bio into 10A later.
      You maybe get new students (because parents moved house). So I highly don't recommend this!

    <p>
      Before adding activities you need to do a planning. Currently FET doesn't help you with this.
      So you already need to think about all activities.
      Has every students the correct number of activities (subject and duration)?
      Has every teacher the correct number of activities (duration)?
      Is it possible that activities of courses are simultaneously? (Think about teachers and rooms!)

    <h4 id="id_15">Add an activity</h4>
    <p>
    <img src="pictures/add.png" alt="Add an activity" />
      To add an activity you just need to add (double click with the mouse, or select and press enter) students, subject and teachers.
      Normally an activity contain 1 teacher, 1 group and 1 subject.
      You should always enter the number of hours that this activity is instructed.
      The <a href="#id_19">Min n days between a set of activities</a> constraint is one of the most important constraints.
      So this constraint is added by default if you add more then one (sub-)activity.

    <h4 id="id_36">Add a fortnightly activity</h4>
    <p>
      There are two big possibilities to add activities that take place once every two weeks.
      The recommended one is to use one of the following workarounds.
      The other one is to do it on a very exact way.<br />
      The advantage of the workarounds is a very simple input of the activities.
      The disadvantage is that you might not get the best timetable and it's not easy to differ fortnightly activities from regular activities in the printed timetable.
    </p>

    <h5>Using a workaround</h5>
    <p>
      All workarounds based on a simple idea:
      Just add a fortnightly activity as a regular activity and call the students and teachers that this activity is only instructed every second week.
    </p>
    <p class="hint">
      If students are not allowed to have gaps, then fortnightly activities should get constraint <a href="#id_24">activity ends day</a> or constraint <a href="#id_26">preferred time(s)</a> with first periods as preferd times.
      If students also need constraint <a href="#id_23">students early</a>, then you should only use constraint <a href="#id_24">activity ends day</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="warning">
      Be careful if you have room problems.
      In many cases <a href="#id_46">Home room(s)</a> will not care about fortnightly activities.
      You need to use a <a href="#id_29">Preferred room(s)</a> constraint.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
      A teacher instruct an activity to group 1A in odd calender week and to group 1B in even calender week.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Variant 1: Add only one activity for this.
      Just add both groups into one activity. This imply, that "both" activities are scheduled at the same period.<br />
      Variant 2: Add two different activities for this.
      This imply, that both activities are scheduled at different periods.
      So this is not recommended if you room problems, because a room will be always occupied, even it is not used.
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <div class="example">
      A students set is instructed by different teachers in different calender weeks.

      Just add both teachers into one activity.
      This imply, that "both" activities are scheduled at the same period.<br />
      Variant 2: Add two different activities for this.
      This imply, that both activities are scheduled at different periods.

      You have two fortnightly activities with different teachers and students.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Variant 1: Add two different activities for this.
      This will effect the best timetable if you have no room problems.<br />
      Variant 2: Add only one activity for this.
      Just add all teachers and students into one activity.
      This imply, that "both" activities are scheduled at the same period.
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <div class="example">
      A teacher T1 instruct group G1 and a teacher T2 instruct group G2. In the following week the teachers change the groups. So T1 instruct G2 and T2 instruct G1.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Variant 1: Add just one activity with all teachers and students.
      This imply, that "all four" activities are scheduled at the same period.
      But consider that only one room is reserved. So just use this if you have no room problems.<br />
      The next two variants should be used if you have room problems. They doesn't differ in the timetable solution.
      They just differ in the visual printed timetable.<br />
      Variant 2: Add two activities and add constraint <a href="#id_27">Same starting time</a> to this activities.
      Variant 3: Add "both" activities just as one activity (like variant 1),
      add a pseudo activity (with no teacher and no room) and add constraint <a href="#id_27">Same starting time</a> to this activities.<br />
      Variant 3: Add four different activities for this.
      This will effect that four different periods are needed! So in many cases this is not recommended.
      Especially if you have room problems.
    </div>

    <h5>The exact way</h5>
    <div class="warning">
      The exact way can maybe find a better solution, but is not recommended, because it's much more work.
      So entering the dataset and generating a timetable need much more time (at least 2 times).
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      You need to enter 2 weeks in the basic settings. Enter all activities 2 times.
      One time with activity tag "odd weeks" and the other time with activity tag "even weeks".
      The forthrightly activities are just entered one time.
      Set a constraint preferd time to activities with activity tag "odd week" to periods of the "odd week".
      Do the same with "even weeks". Be careful many constraints must be added two times!

    <p>
      Every constraint has a weight. A weight of 100% mean that this constraint must be respected.
      A lower value mean it should be respected, it's not necessary.
      It's pretty difficult to explain the exact function, but a simple illustration is the following:
       50% weight mean that in average FET retries two times to place an activity without a conflict.
      If FET isn't able to place the activity without a conflict after average 2 times it keeps the conflict and tries to place the next activity.<br />
      This is not an exact explanation of the algorithm, because the activities might get unallocated or cycle reopened.
    </p>
    <p class="hint">
      Always save the datafile under a different name (just number them) after adding or modifying a constraint.

    </div>
    <p></p>
    <div class="hint">
      How to do a good and correct weight?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      In my opinion nearly all constraints should have weight 100%.
      Especially constraints that have an other maximum value (like max days/periods/gaps).
      The <a href="#id_19">Min n days between a set of activities</a> constraint is a little bit tricky.
      It should be always 100%, only course activities in 100% filled timetables should have sometimes lower values.
      Read section <a href="#id_12">Years, groups and subgroups</a> and <a href="#id_19">Min n days between a set of activities</a> to understand why.<br />
      So of course it's a nice idea to write down a list of all needed constraints and order them by importance.
      But I do not recommend to set weight to 100% to the most important constraint, maybe 99% to the second important constraint and so on until the last one.<br />
      I recommend to add all constraints step by step with weight 100% (except a few <a href="#id_19">Min n days between a set of activities</a> constraints).
      If you add a constraint with an other value (like max days/periods/gaps) then also use weight 100%, but use a high value.
      After all constraints are added and if FET is still able to find a solution, begin decreasing the max days/periods/gaps values.

      Both teachers have good reasons why they need duration 1 or 2 consecutive.
      French is a intellectual subject and 4 activities with duration 1 at different days will have a much better learning progress.
      Industrial art is a technical subject and it is better to work at a project without many interrupts.<br />
      So think about conflicts like this as early as possible.
      Talk to the teachers, explain the problem and find an agreement.
      A maybe solution is this: The French teacher get 4 activities with duration 1 and 100% weight of constraint <em>Min n days</em>.
      This mean the the industrial art teacher "only" get a activity that is splited into 4 parts (two with duration 2 and two with duration 1).
      In the strict sense this activity doesn't need a constraint <em>Min n days between</em>, because the <em>Min n days</em> constraint of the French activity already care about that.
      FET also care about that Latin is directly instructed before or after French, because industrial art need duration 2. - Also have a look at the nature science now.
      This also mean it is impossible that all subjects have only 1 activity with duration 2.

      Think about using constraint <a href="#id_21">max days per week</a> for every single teacher.
      It's maybe much better, because it has a rough effect and the teacher don't need to drive to the institution.

    <p class="warning">
      In many schools it is not allowed that activities are omitted.
      If impeded teachers must be represented by other teachers you might get big trouble if you add to many <em>min periods daily</em> constraint for teachers,
       because there might be not enough teachers to cover activities.

      Of course if the contract of employment guarantee a max number of days per week, then this is an important constraint.

    <p class="warning">
      A timetable is not solvable if you add constraint <em>max days per week</em> with only 3 days and weight 100%

    <p>
      Most teacher like a free day. Check the teacher statistics.
      Check if a teacher is able to (maybe) get free day.
      So the number of periods per day of the teacher must be lower or equal then the number of periods per week of the timetable minus the number of periods per day.
      Also check if a lower number of working days doesn't controvert to a constraint (especially a constraint <a href="#id_19">Min n days between a set of activities</a>).
      Add constraint <em>Max days per week for a teacher</em> with weight 100% if nothing argue against it. Don't add to many constraint at one time.
      Maybe begin with the teacher that instruct the lowest number of periods per week.
      Check if the timetable is still solvable. Add the next teacher if it is still solvable.
      Remove the constraint if the timetable is not solvable and try to add the following teacher.

      This constraints can be used to affect the minimum number of gaps per day.
      If someone get a constraint Max hours continuously with value 4, then it mean he will never teacher more then 3 hours continuously.

      If you order two activities, then it might happen that listining is on Monday and the practise is on Tuesday.
      Sounds correct and maybe also sound like this is needed, but think more carefully. What happen if the activity on Tuesday doesn't take place because of ill teacher,
      ill students, holiday, field day, school trip or other reasons. The "needed" order is confused. It is nearly impossible to keep such an order the whole year.
      So why adding such an strict constraint if you can't keep the order over the whole year? Just because of the first week? In my opinion that is nonsense.
      Even if the first week start with an practise lesson that realy doesn't matter. You have enough other things to do in the first lesson (Get to know your students,
      check their previous knowledge, give an overview about the year or maybe just do a listing lesson.).<br />

      In the easier way you don't need constraint <em>A set of activities has same starting time (day+hour)</em>. Just move all needed teachers and students in one activity. But by this they get only one room. But there are at least 3 needful examples:
    </p>
    <div class="example">
      In the classes are male and female students.
      You maybe want to schedule sport separated by girls and boys.
      Of course you can do it by using a new <a href="#id_12">category</a>.
      But in (nearly) 100% filled timetables this mean that they must have sport simultaneously.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      If the first activity is subject sport, teacher 1 and group 10A, the second activity is subject sport, teacher 2 and group 10B.
      Add constraint <em>A set of activities has same starting time (day+hour)</em> to this to activities.
      Now teacher 1 can instruct all boys of group 10A and 10B; teacher 2 can instruct all girl of this groups.<br />
      This work well if the number of groups/classes is not odd in a year.
      If the number of groups is odd, then just connect to classes of two different years together (maybe 10C and 9C).
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <div class="example">
      The native language teacher is teaching 4 periods per week in a group.
      But at 1 out of the 4 periods an other teacher is team teaching.
      So you can't just add this teacher to the activity, because in the other 3 periods he should teach somewhere else.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Variant 1: Add an pseudo activity. This activity just include the team teaching teacher.
      Now add constraint <em>A set of activities has same starting time (day+hour)</em> with the pseudo activity and one out of the four native language activities.
      You need to uncheck the block checkbox to see a single activities.
      If you have teacher home rooms this variant mean two rooms a locked for the team teaching activity.<br />
      Variant 2: Add one activity with both teachers and duration 1.
      Add a second activity with the native language teacher and total duration 3.
      Add the first single activity into the automatic generated Min n days constraint of the last activities.
    </div>

    <h4 id="id_28">Not overlapping</h4>
    <p>
      The not overlapping constraint is:<br />
      <em>Time constraints (activities)</em> &rarr; <em>A set of activities are not overlapping</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Activities with same teacher or same students or same room are never overlapping by default.
      (compare <a href="#id_17">Basic compulsory time and room constraints</a>).
      So this constraint is only needed in very special situations.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
      There are 2 very important guys with a special skill.
      You know that one of them is sometimes away (or ill) and the other guy need to represent the other.
      Of course that is only possible if he have no activity at the same time.

    <p>
      The home rooms constraints are:<br />
      <em>Space constraints (teachers)</em> &rarr; <em>A teacher has a home room</em><br />
      <em>Space constraints (teachers)</em> &rarr; <em>A teacher has a set of home rooms</em><br />
      <em>Space constraints (students)</em> &rarr; <em>A set of students has a home room</em><br />
      <em>Space constraints (students)</em> &rarr; <em>A set of students has a set of home rooms</em>
    </p>
    <p class="definition">
      Home rooms are the default rooms. They are allocated if there is no <a href="#id_29">Preferred room(s)</a> constraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many institutions have home rooms to groups or teachers.
      You don't need to add home room constraints if every group (or teacher) have it's own home room.
      So you don't need to add home room constraints because you already know that there will never be a conflict.
      Add home rooms constraints only if some groups (or teachers) share rooms
       or if you want to display them into the timetable.
    </p>
    <p class="warning">
      FET didn't allocate a home room if a activity contain more then 2 teachers or students sets.
      Use a <a href="#id_29">Preferred room(s)</a> constraint for that activities if you need to allocate a room.
    </p>
    <p class="warning">
      Don't use teachers home room constraints and students home room constraints at the same time.
    </p>
    <p class="warning">
      Read chapter preferd rooms before you add home rooms.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
      Every teacher should get his own home room. Sadly there are more teachers then rooms at the institution.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Your institution instruct 6 periods per day at 5 days a week. So the institution has 30 periods per week.
      Now count the number of periods that every teacher is working in his homeroom.
      You will see that some teacher work many hours in their home room.
      But there will also be teacher that work less hours in their homeroom.
      Not only because they are half time teachers, also because they maybe just teach math in the homeroom but physic in the lab.
      Some teacher even don't need a homeroom, because they teach only in special rooms.
      Now count the number of teachers that need home rooms; maybe you already have enough rooms.
      If not you need to check two variants:<br />
      Variant 1: Check if 2 (or more) teacher can share a home room.
      So the number of teaching periods from all teachers that share a single room can be maximum the number of periods per week of the institution.
      Add the same room to all teachers that should share a single room (constraint <em>A teacher has a home room</em>).<br />
      Variant 2: Maybe you have bad luck and there are no teachers that can share a single room.
      In that case one (or some) teacher need two (or more) home rooms (constraint <em>A teacher has a set of home rooms</em>).
      Before using this constraint you should think about using constraint <em>An activity has a preferred room</em> to activities of that teacher.
    </div>
    <p>
      You counted the number of home room periods of every teacher and wrote down a list of teacher that could share a home room.
      But which teachers should share a single home room?
    </p>
    <p class="hint">
      Check if teachers that instruct in the same special room can share a home room.
      For example teacher T1 instruct math and physics and teacher T2 instruct history and physics.
      Physics is instructed in the lab. Math and history is instructed in the home room.
      So if teacher T1 instruct physics, then the lab is used by T1.
      So T2 will never be able to instruct physics at the same time as T1, but that also mean the home room of T1 is free and T2 can use that home room.
    </p>
    <p class="warning">
      Be careful if you share a special room with an other institution and so you also use <em>A room is not available</em> at the same time.
      For example you have a hugh gym that has 3 room but you can't use it every day because also an other school use it.
      Teacher T3 instruct math and sports and teacher T4 instruct history and sports.
      So this teachers can maybe never share a home room, because they must use the gym at the same time.
    </p>
    <p class="hint">
      Sometimes (especially if you just need the last link of 2 teachers) it's the best if the teachers with the lowest number of home room periods share a room.

      Subject physics must always be instructed in physics lab or chemistry lab.<br />
      Add <em>A subject has a set of preferred rooms</em>.<br />
      So it might happen that physics is instructed in chemistry lab even the physics room is free.

    <h2 id="id_30">Statistics</h2>
    <p>
      Check the teachers and students statistics before generating a timetable.
      You can check if all activities are (hopefully) added correct.
      It's also useful to check the statistics if you want to add some constraints.
      (like max days per week or max gaps)

    <p>
      Maybe not every timetable is solvable. Remove constraints if FET fail to find a solution.
      Contact the author if you know that a solution is possible.
      Don't add to many constraints at one time and always save with a new file name.

    <h3 id="id_41">Generating a timetable</h3>
    <p>
      There are two different ways to generate timetables:<br />
      <em>timetable</em> &rarr; <em>generate new</em><br />
      <em>timetable</em> &rarr; <em>generate multiple variants</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Generating a timetable is very random process.
      So it might happen that generating a timetable just need a few seconds and generating a timetable with the same dataset need the next time several minutes.
      I can't say how much time is needed to your timetable,
      but I know datasets that need several hours to solve even on a modern computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't wonder if the number of placed activities stop or even decrease sometimes.
      That is normal. Just try some sample files. They are all solvable.
    </p>



    <div class="back"><a href="#id_1" style="color:gray;">Table of contents</a></div>
    <h3 id="id_42">View a timetable</h3>
    <p>
      If you generated a single timetable by <em>timetable</em> &rarr; <em>generate new</em>,
      you can view the timetables by:<br />
      <em>timetable</em> &rarr; <em>view (students)</em><br />
      <em>timetable</em> &rarr; <em>view (teachers)</em><br />
      <em>timetable</em> &rarr; <em>view (rooms)</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      *** you can lock activities here *** who need it? Good example?
    </p>
    <p>
      I recommend to view the timetables with an web browser.
      They are saved in html format.
      On Linux systems they are stored in <code>~/fet-results/</code> and
       on Windows systems they are stored in a subdirectory <code>/results/</code> of the FET directory.

    <h3 id="id_39">Before releasing a timetable</h3>
    <p>
      I recommend to do four things:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You should tell all teachers at a meeting or by a paper all constraints you want to care about.
        Ask all teachers if that constraints are correct or if constraints are missing.
        Maybe it's the best if the other teacher must write down all their constraints and wishes.
        So you will not forget a constraint and no one can affront you later that you didn't care about a special constraint.
        By talking about constraints in a meeting the other teacher will understand better why some have more gaps then others
         and this will reduce a lot of trouble and misunderstandings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Check the <code>conflicts.txt</code> file in the result directory.
      </li>
      <li>
        If your institution need to cover impeded teachers you should check the <code>Teachers' Free Periods</code> file in the result directory. (compare <a href="#id_40">Teachers' Free Periods</a>)
      </li>
      <li>
        Before releasing a timetable to the students you should release an unofficial timetable to the teachers.
        Do that as early as possible, so the other teachers can check your work.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      It's very important to do that <strong>before</strong> the semester starts.
      Normally a institution has a meeting before the next semester begin,
       so you should do it at the latest at this meeting!
      Of course this two hints means that you have to work a little bit more before you can release a timetable,
       but you will have much more trouble and work if you release a buggy timetable.
    </p>

    <h3 id="id_38">How to change a running timetable?</h3>



    <div class="back"><a href="#id_1" style="color:gray;">Table of contents</a></div>
    <h4 id="id_48">Before changing a running timetable</h4>
    <p>
      Be critical yourself. Did you care about the hints that are described in chapter <a href="#id_14">Prearrangement</a>?
      So you ask the teachers for constraints before releasing a timetable and released an unofficial timetable first?
    </p>
    <p>
      If you didn't care about that you have bad luck.
      Add the needed constraints and care about <strong>new</strong> constraints (see below).
      Don't forget to care about this hints this time!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you care about that that hints you should inquire why you need to change the current timetable.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a teacher forgot to tell you a constraint and you see that it's not necessary, I recommend to be stiff.
      Don't be to amiable and courteous. Don't add his constraint and don't generate a new timetable.
      I recommend that, because first of all be sure that you might get a new bug by solving an other one.
      Especially because there are <strong>new</strong> constraints you currently don't know (see below).
      You will get a lot of trouble if you don't care about them!
      Secondly other teachers will also come later and ask for new constraints,
       but maybe you will not be able to care about them and/or you get new bugs by that.
      So if you care about a teacher who didn't care about you (You already asked him to tell you missing constraints
       and asked him to check the unofficial timetable!) you will just have a lot of work and a lot of trouble in the college.
      All other teachers just will be dissatisfied and some might think that you give special  privileges to a few teachers.
      Only by being strict the other teacher will respect you deadlines in the future.
      Of course necessary constraints must be added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe you wonder why I am talking about new bugs,
       because you followed my recommendation and set weight of all constraints to 100% and FET found a solution without any conflict.
      But by this "only" the whole timetable is fair and conflict free.
      Some teachers maybe don't view the whole timetable, they maybe just see their personal timetable and that might be not as good as before.<br />
      Example: The first time you added all constraints with 100% weight.
      Then you added constraint max gap per week and reduced that value step by step.
      FET was able to solve the timetable with max 5 gaps per week, but it wasn't able to solve it with 4 gaps per week.
      So you released timetable with max 5 gaps per week.
      Some days later you changed the running timetable (You added or changed some constraints).
      Fortunately FET was still able so solve the timetable with max 5 gaps per week.
      So the "whole" timetable is fair and you released it.
      But some teachers might be angry, because they got in the old timetable only 1 or even 0 gaps by accident.
      In the new timetable they have more (up to 5) gaps. So you see the problem?
      Some guy might be angry, but adding a constraint with a lower max gaps per week to that teachers is not good,
       because it's not fair to the other teachers and also the timetable will be much more difficult (or even impossible) to solve.
      That is why I recommend to "Never change a running timetable" if it is not necessary.

    <h4 id="id_49">Changing a running timetable</h4>
    <p>
      If you must regenerate the timetable you must care about <strong>new</strong> constraints, not only the missing one!
      Some teachers get free periods or even whole days free (by accident).
      This teacher maybe already have some other (private) activities that you don't know!
      They might have consultation to a doctor, don't have a babysitter for their children, ... .
      So ask all teachers if they have compulsory free periods now.
      Add this constraints (as a rule <a href="#id_18">A teacher is not available</a>).
      Also add the missing constraint.
      Hopefully FET is still able to find a solution.
      If not you must think about increasing the number of max gaps or maybe also removing some constraints.

    <p>
      In many schools it is not allowed that activities are omitted.
      There are many reasons why an activity might be omitted:
        A teacher is maybe ill, is on a school trip with his class, visit a further education, ... .
    </p>
    <p>
      If impeded teachers must be represented by other teachers you might get big trouble if you add to "good" gap constraints,
       to many "min days per week" or to strict "min hours per day" constraints to teachers.
      The problem is that there might be not enough teachers to cover activities.
      Of course the number of free periods to every teacher is still the same,
       but especially many teachers with free days mean that you need a very loyal college.
      That constraint increase chance that teachers must represent at their free day other teachers!
      So might get trouble by that, mainly if you can inform that teachers only a few minutes or hours before he must represent an activity.
      The teacher is maybe not at home, because he do other things at his free day.
      So always check the "Teachers' Free Period" timetable before you release an (unofficial) timetable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recommend to check the "Less Detailed" table before you release a timetable.
      Only if you have a very loyal college you maybe need to check only the "Detailed" table.<br />
      Fist of all you need to check every period of the week.
      Have a look if there are enough teachers per period.
      If you see a period with only one teacher it mean that you can cover only one ill teacher at that period.
      So if two teachers are ill at the some day you are not able to cover both activities.
      If there is an empty period, then you can't even cover a single activity at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      For your daily work you normally use the "Less Detailed" timetable.
      Use the "Detailed" table only in emergency (because in the "Less Detailed" table are not enough teachers to cover all activities).
    </p>
    <p>
      There are different teachers' free periods visible in the table.<br />
      In the “Less detailed” table are 5 different kinds of teachers' free periods: single gaps, boarder gaps, big gaps, must stay longer and must come earlier.<br />
      In the “detailed” table are also this kinds of teachers: must stay much longer, must come much earlier, free day and not available.

      "must come earlier": The teacher must come 1 period earlier to school as normal.
      So it's imported to tell that teacher as early as possible that he must driver earlier as normal to school.
    </p>
    <p class="definition">
      "must come much earlier": The teacher must come 2 or more periods earlier to school as normal.

    </p>

      (So he has one gap directly before OR directly after that free period.)

    <p class="definition">
      "big gap": The teacher has an free period (gap) directly before AND directly after that gap.

      Maybe you wonder why teachers that have a break are missing in this table.
      Pretty easy. If that period is a break, you will never need to cover an activity, because all teachers have free at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need to cover an activity, you must choose a teacher in the "Teachers' Free Period" table.
      It's difficult to say which teacher you should use. I tried to order the teachers by a general rule.
      But in some cases it's better to choose an other teacher first.
      Maybe it's better to choose a teacher that instruct the same group first.
      Maybe it's better to choose a teacher that instruct the same subject.
      Maybe it's better not to choose the first teacher, because he already instruct so many periods this day or week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe after some time you understand better this timetable and want to hide the descriptions in that timetable,
       because they just flood the timetable with unneeded information (because you are ale to differ the free periods by the different colours.).
      You can hide the descriptions by <a href="#id_55">Hide Elements</a> with css.

    <h3 id="id_43">Print timetables</h3>
    <p>
      The default tool to print a timetable is a web browser,
       not a office program (like OpenOffice Writer or Calc),
       because the timetables are saved in html format and the import filters of office tools are not very good at the moment.
    </p>
    <div class="hint">
      You want to publish a pdf file.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Check if your web browser or operating system support <em>printing to pdf</em> or <em>exporting to pdf</em>
      Sometimes it is called <em>pdf Printer</em> or <em>print into file as pdf</em>.
      You should search in your <em>printer settings</em> or in <em>File</em> &rarr; <em>Export</em> of your web browser.
      Windows user normally need to install a pdf print driver first.
    </div>
    <p>
    </p>
    <div class="hint">
      Check if you use the latest version of the web browser. Try different web browser software.
    </div>
    <p>
      Every Web browser has different advantages.
      Changing the font size is very easy with Firefox. Opera  highlights text very fast. ... .
      So please try at least 2 of this web browsers:<br />
      - Firefox http://www.firefox.com/<br />
      - Opera http://www.opera.com/<br />
      - Konqueror (default Linux/KDE web browser)<br />
      - Internet Explorer http://www.microsoft.com/
    </p>
    <p>
      In the easiest case you just have to open a timetable file with a web browser and print it by selecting <em>File</em> &rarr; <em>Print</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A page-break is done after every table if you saved the html files at least with html level 2 (<em>FET</em> &rarr; <em>settings</em> &rarr; <em>html level</em>).
      But that doesn't mean that every table is on a single page! (compare next hint)
    </p>
    <div class="warning">
      Check the print preview with your web browser (<em>File</em> &rarr; <em>Print Preview</em>) before printing.
      Check every single page!
    </div>
    <p>
      If a timetable doesn't fit on a single paper you can do three things:<br />
      - make the tables smaller (see below)<br />
      - make the paper larger (Reduce borders in the printer settings, crop the borders in the page settings of your web browser or use an larger printer.)<br />
      - maybe choose landscape format (in your printer settings)
    </p>
    <p>
      You can make the tables smaller by:<br />
      - a web browser<br />
      - styling the html file with css<br />
      - editing the html file manually (not easy)
    </p>
    <p>
      You can (maybe) reduce (and increase) the size of tables very easily with a web browser.
      Sadly every web browser hide this feature at different places.<br />
      - Open the print preview of your web browser and check if you can toggle the scale. <br />
      - Go to something like <em>File</em> &rarr; <em>Page Setup</em> or <em>File</em> &rarr; <em>Print</em> &rarr; <em>Options</em>
        and check if you can do something like <em>Fit to Paper Width</em>, <em>Shrink to Fit Page Width</em>,
        <em>proper size automatically</em> or choose an other scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can reduce (and increase) the size of tables easily with css by:<br />
      - reducing font size<br />
      - collapse borders<br />
      - hide elements (maybe hide caption, activity tags, rooms, table foot, ...)
    </p>
    <p>
      You can reduce the size of tables with html by:<br />
      - removing unneeded columns or rows
    </p>



    <div class="back"><a href="#id_1" style="color:gray;">Table of contents</a></div>
    <h3 id="id_44">Print multiple tables on a single page</h3>
    <p>
      There are two different ways to print multiple table on a single page:<br />
      - by css<br />
      - by printer driver
    </p>




    <div class="back"><a href="#id_1" style="color:gray;">Table of contents</a></div>
    <h4 id="id_50">2 table on a single sheet by css</h4>
    <p>
      If you have enough space to print always two timetables on a single page then you need a <code>page-break</code> after every second table.
      Open the css file with an editor. You can see in the beginning the following lines:
    </p>
<pre><code>table {
 page-break-before: always;
 text-align: center;
}

table.modulo2 {

}</code></pre>
    <p>
      Just remove the declaration <code>page-break-before: always;</code> from selector <code>table</code>
      and paste it into selector <code>table.modulo2</code>. So it should look like this:
    </p>
<pre><code>table {
 text-align: center;
}

table.modulo2 {
 page-break-before: always;
}</code></pre>
    <p class="warning">
      Check the print preview. Check every single page! The size of tables is not always the same.
      So there are maybe 2 larger tables that doesn't fit on a single page.
      Read *** to understand how solve that problem.
    </p>



    <div class="back"><a href="#id_1" style="color:gray;">Table of contents</a></div>
    <h4 id="id_51">2, 4 or 8 table on a single sheet by your printer driver</h4>
    <p>
      I recommend to check the print preview of your web browser first.
      There shouldn't be much free space on a page.
      So one or two timetables should use nearly the whole page.
      Now check if your web browser or printer support to print several pages on a single sheet.
      Have a look if you can set something like that in <em>File</em> &rarr; <em>Print</em> &rarr; <em>Properties</em> or in <em>File</em> &rarr; <em>Page Setup</em>.
      If your printer doesn't support printing several sheets an a single sheet you can check if your pdf print driver support that.
      So print (save) into a pdf file first and print that pdf file.
    </p>



    <div class="back"><a href="#id_1" style="color:gray;">Table of contents</a></div>
    <h3 id="id_45">Style the html files with css</h3>
    <p>
      css means cascade style sheet. This is the easiest way to style the timetables.
      For example you can change colour and font size or hide elements.
      Your timetables must be saved with html level 5 to get access to all features (<em>FET</em> &rarr; <em>settings</em> &rarr; <em>html level</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Edit a css file with an editor. Don't do that with an office software.
      Linux user can use one of the enclosed editors (Kate, Kwrite, ...)
      Windows user can work with notepad++ http://sourceforge.net/projects/notepad-plus/
    </p>
    <p>
      Open the css file. The file is in the same directory as the html files.
      If you have an good editor you should see that the css text is displayed in different colours.
      That syntax highlighting is done automatically by your editor and it will help you reading and searching bugs.
    </p>



    <div class="back"><a href="#id_1" style="color:gray;">Table of contents</a></div>
    <h4 id="id_52">Comments</h4>
    <p>
      First of all you can see lines that start with <code>/*</code> and end with <code>/*</code> like this:
    </p>
<pre><code>/* CSS Stylesheet of german_sample.fet
   Stylesheet generated with FET 5.4.18 */</code></pre>
    <p>
      That is a comment. This text is just to you. The web browser don't read that lines.
    </p>



    <div class="back"><a href="#id_1" style="color:gray;">Table of contents</a></div>
    <h4 id="id_53">Selectors</h4>
    <p>
      Second of all you can see many statements like this:
    </p>
<pre><code>table {
  page-break-before: always;
  text-align: center;
}

table.modulo2 {

}</code></pre>
    <p>
      Here are two statements.
      A statement start with an selector, followed by opening curly brace, maybe a declaration and a closing curly brace.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this example the selector <code>table</code> has a declaration.
      But the selector <code>table.modulo2</code> hasn't a declaration.
      If you already know html, you will remark that the name of selectors are similar
       to html element names or classes, because this selectors will affect that elements.
      If you don't know html, you will need to understand what this statement affect in the html file.
      You can check it pretty easy. Just write <code>color: red;</code> into ONE declaration.
      So it should look like this:
    </p>
<pre><code>table {
  page-break-before: always;
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

table.modulo2 {

}</code></pre>
    <p>
      Save the css file and reload the html file.
      As you already imagine tables are coloured red in the html document now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remove <code>color: red;</code> out of the declaration of the css file and paste it in the next declaration.
      Save the css file again and reload the html file again.declaration
      You will see that only every second table is red now.
      Repeat this until with (all) other selectors until you understand the affect of all selectors.
    </p>



    <div class="back"><a href="#id_1" style="color:gray;">Table of contents</a></div>
    <h4 id="id_54">Colours</h4>
    <p>
      You already know how to colour an element.
      You can also set a background colour by <code>backgound-color</code>. Just do it like this:
    </p>
<pre><code>td.teacher, div.teacher {
  background-color: gray;
  color: blue;
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      If you add this lines into the selector <code>td.teacher, div.teacher</code> then all teacher names are written with blue colour on gray background.
    </p>
    <p>
      Css know this colours: black, gray, silver, white, purple, fuchsia, maroon, red, olive, yellow, green, lime, navy, blue, teal, aqua and orange.
    </p>



    <div class="back"><a href="#id_1" style="color:gray;">Table of contents</a></div>
    <h4 id="id_55">Hide Elements</h4>
    <p>
      A nice feature to reduce the size of tables is to hide some elements.
      For example to hide all activity tags just write <code>display:none;</code> into  selector <code>span.activitytag</code>.
      So it should look like this:
    </p>
<pre><code>span.activitytag {
  display:none;
}</code></pre>



    <div class="back"><a href="#id_1" style="color:gray;">Table of contents</a></div>
    <h4 id="id_56">Validate the css file</h4>
    <p>
      If you edit the css file it might happen that you do some mistakes.
      To avoid and find bugs turn on syntax highlighting of you editor and
      check the css file with an css validator. ( for example http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate-by-upload )

FET - How to add new translations (languages)
---------------------------------------------

PLEASE E-MAIL THE AUTHOR OR THE MAILING LIST IF YOU WANT TO
TRANSLATE FET INTO YOUR LANGUAGE.



STEP 1.

Modify the file "fet-x.x.x/src/interface/interface.pro", by adding a line
in the TRANSLATIONS section for each language (for instance, adding
a backslash after the last translation and then "fet_it.ts" for italian).

STEP 2.

Enter the directory "fet-x.x.x/src/interface/" and type "lupdate interface.pro".
This will create the needed file, named "fet-x.x.x/translations/fet_**.ts".

STEP 3.

Open the file "fet-x.x.x/translations/fet_**.ts" (for example, fet_it.ts)
with the Qt Linguist and edit it, then save it.

You do not have to translate all the fields. For instance, the FAQ
is very large. Just leave the corresponding fields marked as unfinished.

STEP 4.

From Qt Linguist, release the translation as "fet-x.x.x/translations/fet_**.qm"
(for instance, fet_it.qm).

STEP 5.

Send all the three modified files to the author. You will be added 
as a translator, of course.


Of course, anyone can redo/improve current translations. The best variants will be chosen.


Some other details follow:

 First of all, you need a version of Qt Linguist.
 
 For GNU/Linux it is available if you type "linguist" (usually, Qt
 is installed. If not, you can download and install it from trolltech.com,
 the open source version). For Windows, you will have to download
 the latest Qt from trolltech.com, the latest open source version,
 preferably the self extracting precompiled version for mingw.
 
 An alternative solution for Windows is to download:
 http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/psi/qtlinguist-3.0.4.zip?download
 But this is not the latest version of the linguist.
 
 fet_**.ts: You will have to open this file using Qt 
 Linguist. The most useful keys are: Ctrl+Enter (activates current translation 
 and jumps to the next untranslated phrase),Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2 (first or second 
 suggestion). You can skip the large fields, like the FAQ and others. You can 
 skip also fields you cannot translate, they will remain in English. But let them
 marked as untranslated.
 
 Please try to follow the original (English) line arrangement. That is, if you 
 meet: "Current activity's <lf>
 	description"
 you have to split your message if it is too wide (wider than the widest line). 
 For instance, the translation would be:
 	"Descrierea activitatii
 	curente"
 
 Please take care to punctuation, because Linguist requires it. You have to end 
 each translation with the same punctuation mark as the English one. For 
 instance:
 	"Compulsory conflicts:"
 would become:
 	"Conflicte obligatorii:"
 If you don't do that, you will get an exclamation mark for this translation.
 
 You will have to save the file (in Qt Linguist) after you have done the 
 modifications (I usually save it every 10 minutes).
 
 It would be a good idea to send me the fet_**.ts file after only a few 
 modifications, so I can check it if it works, so your work is not wasted. If 
 that goes well, I will tell you so that you can continue working on it.
 
 Please tell me if you do not want me to put your e-mail address in the 
 TRANSLATORS field.
 
 In order to test your translation you need to release it as fet_**.qm
 and put it into the directory "translations". Then, rename the file as 
 fet_ro.qm (or any other implemented translation), overwriting the old one,
 and try the Romanian language.

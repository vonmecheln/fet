<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instructions by Liviu Lalescu</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These are some small instructions which
you have to follow in order to input a solvable data set.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If FET cannot find a good timetable for
your school, make sure to write to the author, as FET needs to be
improved. Maybe small changes to your datafile can bring good
solutions, or maybe there are aspects which have to be changed in
FET.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">1) You can use for the constraint min n
days the weight you want. It can be 100%, but please make sure your
timetable is not too constrained. Please take care of the impossible
constraints, they should have 0 weight (percentage). For instance, if
a teacher teaches only two days per week and has 3 math lessons for a
group, then it is clear that the constraint cannot be respected, so
the correct way is to specify a 0 weight (percentage) for min n days
constraints.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">2) It is advisable to restrict the
number of hours and days to the needed value, not larger. The reason
is to guide FET to obtain a good solution. It is not as good to add a
large number of hours per day and add constraint teachers/students
max hours daily, as I observed in practice.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">3) It is advisable to use not
available, break and preferred time(s) to make restrictions. These
will not slow down the generation.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">4) If you have a course lesson with say
4 activities per week, difficult lessons, which you would like to
schedule in the beginning of the day (say 3 out of 4 need to be in
the first half of the day), you can add constraint activity preferred
times for the first three activities, with preferred times in the
first half of the day. This approach worked with the sample German
high-school data.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">5) A real case: for the sample German
file, FET usually finds a solution fast. I tried the following:
increased the day from 6 to 12 hours, and let the students begin
hours at any time (removed students early). I kept the constraint
teachers max gaps per week to 3. But to my surprise, even if the data
was less constrained, FET failed to find a solution. The reason is
that the teachers have a larger possible palette of options, and FET
is not able anymore to optimize their timetable so not to have more
than 3 gaps per week.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The advice is to help FET to have the
data as a human timetabler would have it, helping him by not letting
him with a very large palette of options for each activity and on the
other hand constraining him with max gaps for instance. Try firstly
to see if the timetable can be generated without teachers max gaps
per week, and lower the max gaps limit afterwards.</P>

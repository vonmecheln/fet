Volker Dirr (to contact Volker Dirr visit http://www.timetabling.de/) - implemented and tested 
	two-point and uniform crossover. Two-point crossover is clearly 
	an improvement over the 1-point crossover, originally implemented in FET 
	--------- 30 June 2007 - evolutionary algorithm is deprecated by Liviu Lalescu (so no crossover anymore)

	Lots of helping with testing, bug reports, suggestions, comparisons
	
	Rewriting of the saving the timetable on hard disk. New features: xhtml 1.0 strict valide, using span.

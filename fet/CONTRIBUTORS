Code contributors:

Volker Dirr (to contact Volker Dirr visit http://www.timetabling.de/) - implemented and tested 
	two-point and uniform crossover. Two-point crossover is clearly 
	an improvement over the 1-point crossover, originally implemented in FET 
	--------- 30 June 2007 - evolutionary algorithm is deprecated by Liviu Lalescu (so no crossover anymore)

	Lots of helping with testing, bug reports, suggestions, comparisons

Instructions by Liviu Lalescu

These are some small instructions which you have to follow in order to input a solvable data set.

If FET cannot find a good timetable for your school, make sure to write to the author, as FET needs to be improved. Maybe small changes to your datafile can bring good solutions, or maybe there are aspects which have to be changed in FET.

1) You can use for the constraint min n days the weight you want. It can be 95%, 99.75% or even 100%. If you specify a value below 100% (even 99.75% or more) for an impossible constraint, FET will be able to detect that it is impossible and obtain a timetable in the end, so the weight is subjective. So, the best way would be to choose a 99.75% for all constraints, but the time of generation might be larger than with 95%.

You could try at first the 95% minimum recommended value, then highten the weight percentage up to maybe 99.75% or 100%. I am not sure here, I have not enough sample files (please contribute with advice). If you would like to change the 95% for another value for all constraints of this type, the easiest way is in Data/Time constraints/Min n days between activities dialog, where starting with version 5.3.6 there is a simple command for that.

You might want to choose different weights for different constraint min n days (for instance, higher on subjects with less activities per week)

2) If you have a course lesson with say 4 activities per week, difficult lessons, which you would like to schedule in the beginning of the day (say 3 out of 4 need to be in the first half of the day), you can add constraint activity preferred times for the first three activities, with preferred times in the first half of the day. This approach worked with the sample German high-school data.

3) From the way the algorithm is conceived, the automatic generation is faster if you use students set (or teacher) not available and/or constraint activity(ies) preferred times to specify impossible slots, in addition to possible use of students (set) or teacher(s) max hours daily, whenever it is possible. For instance, if you know that year 5 will only have hours from 8:00 to 13:00, it is better to add students set not available in addition to students set max hours daily. So, if possible, try to follow this advice. This trick helps guide FET better towards a solution.

Each constraint of type not available or preferred times which filters out impossible slots might bring an improvement in speed.

4) For teacher(s) gaps: you have to use 100% weight. You could try with rather large values for max allowed gaps, and lower it as you find possible timetables.

Please note that FET will take care of teacher(s) gaps only if you tell it so, by adding constraint teacher(s) max gaps per week. It is normal to add such constraint(s) after you saw that the data is solveable, using for max gaps a value which seems acceptable, lowering it as you find timetables.

5) Please only input the special rooms with constraints. Home rooms are not necessary (teachers' or students' rooms). You might firstly try togenerate a timetable without rooms, to see if it is possible, then add rooms and rooms related constraints.

6) Constraint students (set) early: if you input only partial data, please use with caution. You might for instance input only 4+4 hourly activities of math with the same teacher for 2 students sets (each group of 4 activities must be ballanced - in different days). Then it is clear that you cannot place all 8 activities in a 5 days week without breaking the students early constraint, so you will get no possible timetable.

7) It is possible to work with institutions in which the students work in shifts (for instance, lowest forms in the morning and highest forms in the afternoon). Please see the Help/Frequently Asked Questions the solution to how to do that (the essence is to add corresponding constraints students set not available).

8) The new algorithm (after version 5.0.0) does not accept fortnightly activities. But you might apply a trick. Please see menu Help/Frequently Asked Questions menu (it has the description of a possible trick) (the essence is to make an activity with the sum of teachers and students of both fortnightly activities)

9) Even if it takes a long time to generate your timetable with a set of constraints, strengthening the constraints might not slow the generation too much. You are adviced to try with stronger constraints after you obtain timetables, because you can obtain better timetables this way.</string>

Q: What is the organization of FET input data?

A: - Students - organized into sets (years (or forms, or classes), containing groups, containing subgroups).

- Teachers.

- Subjects (the names of the possible courses, eg. Maths, Physics, etc.).

- Rooms (classrooms).

- Activities: a coupling of one or more teachers, a subject and one or more students set. This is usually named a course, a lecture, a laboratory and so on.

- Constraints. They can be: time constraints (referring to the allocated day and hour) or space constraints (referring to rooms allocation). They have a weight percentage, from 0% to 100%. 100% means that the constraint will always be respected and if this constraint is impossible, FET will not be able to generate a timetable.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q: How to define the students into sections?

A: Add years and the option "Divide ..." in the years dialog will be all that you need.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q: How does FET work?

A: A heuristic algorithm, based on swapping activities recursively to make space for new activities. Email the author or mailing list for details.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q: What is the structure of the students FET can handle?

A: FET was designed to allow any school structure:

- independent subgroups (non-overlapping);

- overlapping groups (several subgroups) and years (several groups).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q: How can one work with overlapping structures of students?

A: If you have overlapping groups, then you must define the smallest independent subgroup, which does not overlap with any other subgroup. Example: you have 1 group, subject sport (which must be taught to boys and girls separately) and subject physics, which is an optional subject and only some students would like to have this course (yes, FET can manage optional subjects). Then, you must define the subgroups: boys who want physics, boys who do not want physics, girls who want physics, girls who do not want physics. Now, it is very easy. Just define

group girls=subgroup girls who want physics + girls who do not want physics,

group boys=subgroup boys who want physics + boys who do not physics

group physics=boys who want physics + girls who want physics.

Then, you can add as many activities as you want to the corresponding groups:

Activity1: teacher A, group girls, subject sport;

Activity2: teacher B, group boys, subject sport;

Activity3: teacher C, group physics, subject optional physics.

NEW: the thing can be automated now. Select year-&gt;divide in the years dialog.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Can you add more students sets or teachers to a single activity?

A: Yes, you can add several students sets (subgroups, groups or years) and several teachers per activity.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q: How can I contribute to/support FET?

A: You can translate, improve interface, any work. Please email the author or mailing list for details.

FET is free software and any donation would be great. Please contact the author for that.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q: What advantages has FET over other applications?

A: - It is free software and...

- Independent subgroups, overlapping or independent groups, overlapping or independent years (flexible enough to permit any kind of students structure). FET can even be used to manage every individual student, if you really need that;

- Possibility of optional activities;

- Many kinds of constraints, possibility to add many more (please suggest!).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q: What are the disadvantages of FET, compared to other applications?

A: - Very unfriendly (no help, primitive graphical user interface);

- Potentially buggy. I do not have enough sample files for testing FET (and I hate testing :-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q: Does FET compile on other operating systems than GNU/Linux?

A: FET can be compiled easily in operating systems which are similar to GNU/Linux. I will provide help to compile this program on any operating system. In particular, FET can be compiled on Microsoft Windows, if you install Qt from trolltech.com.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Q: Does FET claim to be the best timetabling software in the world, like all the other timetabling applications?

A: I cannot pretend that, because I could not compare FET with other applications (if you could help me, that would be great). All I can say right now is that I did not see any application with as many kinds of constraints and such flexibility as FET, and besides being free software.

Is FET the first free timetabling software (GNU/GPL)? Hmmm... the first one was Tablix, as I found out after finishing FET. You can see links to this software if you look in the LINKS file or if you search it on the Internet.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q: Help on ConstraintMinNDaysBetweenActivities.

A: It refers to a set of activities and involves a constant, N. For every pair of activities in the set, it does not allow the distance(in days) between them to be less than N. If you specify N=1, then this constraint means that no two activities can be scheduled in the same day. N=2 means that each two subactivities must be separated by at least one day

Example: 3 activities and N=2. Then, one can place them on Monday, Wednesday and Friday (5 days week).

Example2: 2 activities, N=3. Then, one can place them on Monday and Thursday, on Monday and Friday, then on Tuesday and Friday (5 days week).

The weight is recommended to be between 95.0%-100.0%. It might be the case that you can use 99.75% for instance and timetable still solveable, and 100% not solveable. Please experiment with these.

You can specify consecutive if same day. Please be careful, even if constraint min n days between activities has 0% weight, if you select this consecutive if same day, this consecutive will be forced. You will not be able to find a timetable with the two activities in the same day, separated by break, not available or other activities, even if the constraint has weight 0%, if you select consecutive if same day.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q: Help on ConstraintStudentsEarly.

A: It is a constraint that imposes the condition that all the students must begin their courses as early as possible. You have to be careful with this constraint: if any set of students begins the classes later than the first hour in a certain day, you will get a conflict.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q: Can I use FET to do interactive timetabling?

A: Yes, but this is not easy. All the part regarding data representation and gradually construction of the solution is working, only the interface has to be updated.

Anyway, when you add a compulsory ConstraintActivityPreferredTime, it means that you fixed that activity. You can use this feature for a semi-automatic or even manual timetabling, but it is not so convenient.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q: After finding the timetable of our school, suppose that a single teacher needs to modify his timetable and the rest would like to keep their timetable unchanged. Thus, it is needed to fix all the activities of the rest of the teachers and re-allocate the hours. Can FET deal with such a situation?

A: Yes, FET can deal with that. Just add many compulsory ConstraintActivityPreferredTime-s, one for each activity that you would like to be fixed (the preferred time will be the one from the previous allocation).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q: From Yush Yuen: Anyway, what i meant was, our teachers may have lunch at EITHER 5th or 6th period. so, i can't just use a break.

A: From Volker Dirr: Just add a subject "lunch". Then add activities new activities. this activities must contain the teacher, subject lunch, split activity into number of working days of the teacher, set min n day = 100% and add NO studentsset. Then add constraint activities preferd time for this subject 5th and 6th hour weight = 100%.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Is it possible to make a timetable where the students learn in two shifts? (for instance, the lowest form in the morning and the highest forms in the afternoon)?

A: Yes, you have to add more constraint students set not available accordingly (for the lowest forms not available Mon, Tue, Wed, Th, Fr each from middle hour to last hour and for highest forms from first hour to middle hour). The constraints no gaps and early work correctly with these not available: if not available, a students set will not have gaps or early broken for the period of non-availability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How can you allow one gap (or more) for students?

A: There is a small workaround: add for each SUBGROUP (careful, for each subgroup, not group or year) an activity with duration 1 (or more activities with duration 1), with no teachers. These are dummy activities which are to be considered gaps.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: What are groups of type "year1 WHOLE YEAR" and subgroups of type "group1 WHOLE GROUP"?

A: These are groups and subgroups inserted automatically by FET if year or group is empty. They are added only when generating timetable. You don't need to use them, just ignore them. It is recommended to remove them if for instance you generate the timetable, they are added and you insert other groups or subgroups after that. They cannot be removed automatically. I know that this is not elegant, but I have no solution for the moment.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: I added an activity with min days constraint. But I cannot see the min days value in modify activity dialog

A: Min days is a time constraint. You can see it in the time constraints dialog

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Can I work with fortnightly activities like in older FET versions?

A: Not explicitly. It would be very difficult to make fortnightly activities into the new FET algorithm (from 5.0.0 up). But I think you can apply a trick: for instance, I suppose that you would like the first week to have teacher t1 with students s1 and teacher t2 with 
students s2, and second week teacher t1 with students s2 and teacher t2 with students s1 (simultaneously). Can't you define a weekly activity, with teachers t1&amp;t2 and students s1&amp;s2?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How to choose the weight percentage of constraint min n days between activities?

A: You can use for the constraint min n days the weight you want. It can be 95%, 99%, 99.75% or even 100%, but please make sure your timetable is not too constrained. Please take care of the impossible constraints, they should have under 100% weight (percentage) - best would be 0%. For instance, if a teacher teaches only two days per week and has 3 math lessons for a group, then it is clear that the constraint cannot be respected, so the correct way is to specify under 100% weight (percentage) for the corresponding min n days constraint - best would be 0%.

You could try at first the 95% minimum recommended value, then highten the weight percentage up to maybe 100%. I am not sure here, I have not enough sample files (please contribute with advice). If you would like to change the 95% for another value, to make the timetable better, you might use a text or xml editor to change the fet datafile faster than from the FET interface (maybe use replace option, like I do, replacing for instance "Percentage&gt;95" with with "Percentage&gt;99" or with "Percentage&gt;99.75" or with "Percentage&gt;100"). It is adviceable to keep all older versions of your datafile.

You might want to choose different weights for different constraint min n days (for instance, higher on subjects with less activities per week)</string>

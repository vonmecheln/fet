The idea of the locked and unlocked icons was suggested by Rodica Lalescu, they were
initially designed by Gigica Nedelcu and Liviu Lalescu, and they were later redesigned
from scratch by Liviu Lalescu (on 6 March 2021), using QCAD Community Edition and Inkscape.
The group and subgroup icons were designed by Liviu Lalescu, using Inkscape.
Fair use of these icons is allowed/encouraged/expected.

[4] Z.Michalewicz, Genetic Algorithms + Data Structures = Evolution Programs (2nd ed.),
Springer-Verlag, 1994 (not free. I cannot say whether it is worth the money, but it 
helped me understand some important concepts. This was a borrowed book and I never had the
opportunity to read other expensive books on genetic algorithms, to compare them).

I will have to add here other great free sources of information I found on the web,
but these were the most useful ones.

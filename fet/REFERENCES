4. For the virtual rooms allocation function we used an algorithm for a randomized maximum bipartite matching of minimum cost, inspired and modified from the
Hopcroft-Karp algorithm, which was described and implemented in pseudocode on the Wikipedia internet page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopcroft%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm.


C++ code references for FET:

1. Qt Documentation: https://doc.qt.io/.

2. A tutorial on pointers and arrays in C, by Ted Jensen, Chapter 9: Pointers and Dynamic Allocation of Memory:
https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2014/readings/pointers.pdf. We used the idea of contiguous memory allocation into a dynamic array.
We used the idea in the file src/engine/matrix.h.

3. C++ FAQ LITE, by Marshall Cline, Section [13] - Operator overloading, Article [13.12]: http://parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/.
We used the recommendation to add the () operator for a dynamically allocated matrix, which is not necessarily slower. We used the
idea in the file src/engine/matrix.h.

In the initial order, in nIncompatible, put also teacher(students)intervalMaxDaysPerWeek, like in teacherMaxDaysPerWeek

---------------------------------------------------------------

From Horatiu Halmajan:

Students max gaps per day

Students set max days per week (but you can use for the moment students (set) interval max days per week).

Max gaps constraints with weight under 100% (this is very difficult)

---------------------------------------------------------------

From George Miliotis:

I want to propose a feature: notes attached to each rule. If I can
attach a small text snippet to rules I can put in there when and who
asked for the rule. This makes "fixing" locked timetables easier cause i
know what rules to remove. Also, I can make notes to myself when i use
'tricks'. EG. set lab1+lab2 for an activity: 'all teacher's courses are
labs but students won't fit in lab 3 so i had to exclude it here'

Horatiu:
For my case, the second idea worked perfectly, as my teacher does not accept
gaps.

I have also "played" with the first with the first idea, as it seems to be
the most un-restrictive one. It also worked. I tried it three times, and in
all three situations at least one of the dummy activities was the first or
the last activity for the teacher's day. So, there is a chance that the
teacher would end up with only one gap.

Which leads me to a suggestion: An activity end (or starts) a teacher's day.
Similar to "an activity ends students's day)

---------------------------------------------------------------

From daviodan:

in Romanian (see below for English translation):

Voi face referire la sample_Brazil_more_difficult_max_2_gaps_for_teachers.fet

1. In fereastra FET activities exista mai multe filtre dupa numele prof,clasa,etc.
Daca de exemplu alegem la Subject "Matematica" si facem filtrarea si dupa numele 
profesorului atunci lista filtrului ar trebui sa contina doar numele :Bruna,Silvania,Wellington 
deoarece doar acestia predau matematica .In momentul de fata filtrul contine lista tuturor profesorilor.
Analog pentru celelalte filtre.

2. In fereastra All time constraints s-ar putea aduga sus un filtru dupa tipul de constrangere ?

3. In fereastra Teachers statistics cand se da click pe numele unui profesor sa apara in dreapta 
intr-o casuta toate constrangerile pentru acel profesor introduse pana in acel moment.

in English:

I will refer to sample_Brazil_more_difficult_max_2_gaps_for_teachers.fet

1. In the FET activities dialog there exist more filters after the teacher, group, etc.
If we choose for instance the subject "Math" and we do the filtering also after the name of 
the teacher, then the list of the filter should contain only the name: Bruna,Silvania,Wellington,
because only these teache Maths. In the present moment the filter contains the list of all teachers.
The same for all the other filters.

2. In the window of all time constraints, could we add a filter after the type of constraint?

3. In the teachers' statistics dialog, when we click a teacher, there should appear in the right
in a box all the constraints for this teacher inputted by that moment.

---------------------------------------------------------------

From Azu Boba:

Currently there is no option in FET to set desired teaching times for a 
teacher. You can do the opposite, set undesired/unavailable times for a 
teacher, but it's not the same thing. Sometimes you just want a teacher 
to teach on a specific hour (usually on his/her request) without 
specifying the subject/class.
E.g. teacher X wants to start teaching on the first hour every 
Wednesday, without specifying subject/class in order to maximize 
flexibility.
I think this new restriction will be a very helpful addition. Currently, 
I have to generate multiple timetables and browse the results in order 
to pinpoint cases where the specific restrictions are met.

---

Thanks for looking into it!
Yes, currently I am forcing the activities into the slots I want but 
usually it takes a lot of restrictions (teacher not available usually) 
that I need to remember to remove as soon as I find a desirable solution 
in order to keep the general timetable flexible for future changes.
Here in Greece, desired and undesired slots have about the same weight. 
The thing is that not all teaching hours have the same time length (1st 
hour 45min, 2nd 45min, 3rd 45min, 4th 40min, 5th 40min, 6th 40min, 7th 
35min) and some teachers require first hours for some classes in order 
to teach more time consuming subjects (the subject might vary but the 
necessity for the time slot doesn't). That necessarily doesn't that they 
object to teach late hours too.
Also, it is easier to add only one restriction like the one I am 
describing to drag e.g. the teaching hours of a teacher earlier in a day 
than to add multiple not available restrictions at the late hours in 
order to accomplish the same thing. Also, those late hour restrictions 
might make the timetable too rigid and usually without serious reason.
There are also many other examples but are much more complex.
Generally I think that this is something that a lot of other timetable 
organizers would want. Truthfully, it was the 2nd thing I noticed 
missing after the not-so-easy lock/unlock of activities that you 
currently solved.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Volker Dirr:

CONSTRAINT_TEACHERS_MAX_DAYS_PER_WEEK

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Azu Boba:

I like the interface just the way it is now. Only three buttons and very 
obvious of what they do. Checkboxes is not a good idea since at least 
one should be selected at all time and this might create problems. You 
also need to add three buttons too with this solution (lock, unlock, 
toggle) so the interface will become much more confusing. The current 
solution in my opinion is the way to go. The only change I propose is to 
have fixed cell height and width so it would be easier to comprehend and 
pinpoint what you see when switching between teachers.
As I said before, I asked for this feature mainly to quickly lock/unlock 
specific days. With this new build things are much easier but I still 
need to select every single teacher and unlock the specific day I want 
to do changes. It would be much better if I could select one day and 
unlock all the activities for this day. The problem here is that we have 
a 3D table (teachers/days/hours). The best solution for this IMO is to 
add a new view named e.g. "View (day for teachers)" (of course you keep 
the "View (teachers)" too). This view will be similar to "View 
(teachers)" but it will have all the days as selectable tabs on the top. 
The 2D table it will display below the tabs would be the Teachers/Hours 
view for the day selected. The buttons and functionality will be the 
same as in the case of "View (teachers)". This way you will be able to 
easily lock/unlock the whole day. The best part though is that with this 
new View you will be able to better comprehend/modify the schedule in a 
day by day base, so its not just a tool for locking/unlocking activities.
You might also want to consider adding an additional flag when locking 
an activity. This flag might be called "Save data and timetable flag" 
and would be set when an activity is locked automatically during the 
"Save data+timetable as..." procedure. Why? Mainly, because when you 
want to unlock e.g. a specific day in a "Save data+timetable as..." 
saved timetable you do not want to unlock all the activities of the day; 
you want unlocked only the ones that were locked by the "Save 
data+timetable as..." process. There are activities that the schedule 
creator manually locked them before FET generated the table (e.g. a 
specific lesson needs to happen only on a specific day and time). By 
selecting and unlocking a whole day as things are now you unlock these 
activities too! This means that if the schedule creator doesn't pay 
enough attention he might mistakenly create a schedule with activities 
set at undesired hours. The solution I propose to this is to toggle 
between locked/unlocked only the activities that have the "Save data and 
timetable flag" set. To unlock the manually locked ones the user would 
have to do it in a different/manual way (see the paragraph below about 
the editable "Details" box) or even better be asked with a message box 
if he wants to unlock the manually locked activities too.
I also mentioned that in order to remove a teacher from a specific day 
(because he is ill or on a leave) I have to go to "View (teachers)" and 
pinpoint all the activities assigned to the teacher for this day 
(checking their IDs from the "Details" text box and then writing them 
down in notepad). Then I close this view and go to the "Activities" 
list, find the specific activities and uncheck "Active" for them. This 
is a little annoying and a prone to errors procedure especially if there 
are more than one teachers missing. What I thought as a solution for 
this has to do with the "Details" text box on the "View (teachers)". It 
would be great if it wasn't just a simple text box but an editable 
interface for every changeable value. What I have in mind is to split 
the "Details" into two parts; the upper part would include all the non 
editable values while the lower part all the editable ones. Right now 
for me, only the "Active" and "locked time" values are worth of being 
editable, so  simple check boxes would suffice but someone else might 
want other values editable too (e.g. Total number of students, duration) 
or new values worth being editable might be added in the future, so it's 
a good thing to have.
Last but not least (and certainly the most difficult modification) it 
would be great if you could drag and drop activities in the "View 
(teachers)" and "View (day for teachers)" GUIs. Of course by doing so 
you create conflicts and this will need handling. But I think all the 
before mentioned changes are enough work for you now and I need to think 
this a little more to come up with a viable solution.
I hope I gave you valuable feedback and not a headache! Thank you again 
for your time and for this great software that really saved me since 
this school year was the first time I was entrusted with the school's 
schedule and I was way over my head.

Sadly, after a while this number continualy decrease toward 319, 318, 316 , .... 301...
Now if I  decide to stop this decreasing process, I will get a partial timetable with only 301 placed activities   Embarrassed  FET shows a list containing the most 301 difficult placed  activities
Now:
1-Is it possible for FET to save and update the ever best timetable in a simulation session ?
For example, when it reached: 321 out of 323 activities placed, I can easily place those 2 remaining activties manualy by breaking some constraints
2- Where I can find Ids of those 2 remaining activties !?

From Abdul Hadi Kamel Abdullah

Why did you remove the "Teachers-subjecttags max hours continously"
constraint in the new version of FET. It's very important to us.

Without that , the results I got was not so conducive, where a teacher has
to give theoretical lectures (the ones with subject_tag = 'S' for more than
two hours.

The existing two constraints that for teachers which are 'Teachers no more
than X hours continously' and 'Teachers no more than X hours daily' cannot
prevent a teacher to have more than certain number of hours for a
particular subject_tag.

For example:

lets say,

It's better to for a teacher have a timetable on monday as the following :
CASE A

Time : 8am -10 am subject: CSC134   subject_tag : S (means
theoretical-lecture session)
Time : 10am -12pm       subject: CSC203   subject_tag : M (means lab
session)
Time : 2 pm - 4 pm      subject: ITT300         subject_tag : S (means
theoretical-lecture session)

than the following:
CASE B

Time : 8am -10 am subject: CSC134   subject_tag : S (means
theoretical-lecture session)
Time : 10 am - 12 pm    subject: ITT300         subject_tag : S (means
theoretical-lecture session)
Time : 2pm -4pm   subject: CSC203   subject_tag : M (means lab session)

where the teacher in CASE B has to a give theoretical-lectures (in other
words give a continous speech) for 4 hours continously, which most of
teachers don't like.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Danail:

You see, this division in subgroups is very complicated - to understand 
and to add by hand. And at the end you came with a lot of subgroups that 
have only formal sense, for the algorithm, but are visible in dialogs, 
in the final chart and everywhere. It should not be like this. One will 
have to divide years in wizard-like dialog, with questions:
1. How many classes you have for this year?
2. Define courses for which students from this year study together
3. Which of these curses start at same time. Group them by this criteria
4. Define from which classes came students for these courses. Whole 
class is caming, or only part of it? Where other part goes - have rest, 
or has another activity, and if yes - which one?
5. Define teacher that is teaching in every course.

This is a draft, but some wizard like this will save *a lot of" 
mistakes, and will make program much more user friendly. Then you can 
add internal groups, but not show them to users, or at least show if 
they set some option. Show them only groups and subgroups that they need 
to put in activities, and show these same in final html output.

This is my opinion of user in trouble :-)


Second set:
1.Ability to select more than one constraint and delete it, or set its 
weight
2.Ability to disable all informative and warning messages, or to display 
them in status bar or in another log window.
3.Option to remember last focused control in dialogs - very useful if 
you want by keyboard to open many constraints and change their weight
4.Constraint "longest gap is n hours"
5.way to save last generated timetable and reopen it again (for example 
for printing it with different html level, or for viewing it.
6.Ability to show free teachers for every position in students and 
teachers timetable - very useful if you want to find somebody to replace you

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Volker Dirr (28 August 2007):

1. add a constraint. then remoce the constarint. now the constraintlist is
empty, but the right windows ("current constarints") still displays the
infoemation about the already deleted constraint.

2. maybe change "current constaint" into "description", "constraint
information", "description of the selected constraint", ... (very very low
priority, maybe one day)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Volker Dirr, regarding translation:

1. maybe it´s better to be more exact. example: phrases "min hour" better "min hour per day"

2. sometimes it is "Weight percentage (necessary: 100%)" sometimes it is "Weight percentage (needed: 100%)"

3. sometimes the english version isn´t always the same.

sometimes you wrote "add current activity"
sometimes you wrote "add activity"
sometimes you wrote "add current"
sometimes you wrote "add"
i think it should always be the same.

also sentence like: "You have to know that a this constaint ..."
should only be: "This contraint ..."

4. also in the QObject are some "strange" transations.

example:
". This [...]" mabye better "This [...]"
", S:" i think ", " and ":" should not be enterd into the QObject::tr

we have also change phrases like ",
S:%1".

5. maybe "start" should be "generate" in the generateform.

6. more TODO for english phrases:
- if you wrote one or more sentences, please always end with ., ! or ?.
- the head of a dialoge always start with "FET - ..." but sometimes you
wrote "... dialoge".
- sometimes you wrote "students subgroups", i think you just need to write
"subgroups", because teachers have no subgroups.
- all "add", "modify", and "remove", "close" phrases should only contain
this word. no more words like "current" or "group". maybe wrote them with
QObject, because nearly every dialoge have this 4 phrases.

7. phrases like that are not very good:
"NEW: Divide year automatically by selecting categories"

i think we should remove NEW:

and some phrases starts with a new line.

sometimes you write a sentences, then do a new line and then (in the new
line) close the sentence with "."

8. one time you wrote "abort". all other times you wrote "cancel".

9. i think we should think and write a small definition note for english
phrases.

it looks like in a few times this terms are not always used same/correct:
hour
duration
periode
lesson
activity

when we write a small definition note, then we have to care about this:
words must also be correct for schools that don´t use "hours" as one time
hour.
in germany one schoolhour is 45 minutes. but that´s no problem. we use the
same words for that.
but i remember a letter in the maillinglist. that guy wrote that he has 60
minutes hours and 90 minutes hours. so he defined 30 minutes "hours" and
set duration == 2 or duration == 3 to the activities.
so the definiton and use of hour, duration, periode and lesson must also
match to this.

please let us friste a small definistion not for this terms:
hour, duration, periode, lesson, activity
this will help if we add new or modify old english phrases and it will
also help translaters.

10. maybe TODO: no brackets in "view (students)", "view (teachers)", and "view
(rooms)".

11. and it looks like we shouldn´t use the word "lesson".
in the most phases it´s better to replace "lessons" by "subactivities"

12. maybe:
"invalid activity" is better "no activity selected"

13. very low priority maybe:
in mainform->data is this order:
1) instutionname and comment
2) days and hours
3) a) teachers
   b) subjects and subject tag
   c) years/groups/subgroups
4) ...

maybe change order 3 a) with 3 b)
so first subject and sunject tag.
then teachers.
resason: every activity have a subject. so subject is more importent,
because not every activity has a techer or subgroup.

14. that is also why i already asked you to change english translations,
because some phrases can be shorten.
for example all sentences with "you", "current" or "that mean" can be
shorten (in english and german).
example:
"If you insert current group to current year, that means that some years
share the same group (overlap)"

shorten version:
"Some years share this group if it´s inserted."

15. and a maye other thing. example:
view in fet-mainform.
there is "Time contraints (techers)".
and in this folder is for example "Teachers max gaps per Week".
i recommend to write just "Max gaps per Week".
Reason:
- it´s shorter
- it´s clear that it "teachers" contraint, because it´s in that folder

the english version looks fine, because you are always possible to write
first "teachers". (except on time view (Min days between activities. You
are not able to write Activities first.)
In german translation it is much more difficult the write "teacher" always
first. even including the word teacher is a much longer phrases than in
english. it will be much easyer and nice, if we don´t write teacher here.
maybe the same porblem in other languages.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Volker Dirr:

how about this:
if you go to data->activities
the you have 4 different filters where you can choose something.

for example i choose filter subject "DE". now can see all "DE" activities
at the left side. so it is ok like it is, or i see a missing one. if i see
a missing one, then of course i want to add a subject "DE". so this
subject should be default if i press add.

so the function should have four parameters (the four filters),
defaultsetting in the data->activities->add screen should have be the
filters of data->activities.



For multiple generation:

WISHLIST:

1--------------------------------------------------------
From bmlahcen13:

for that i advice to start thinking from now to
- enhance the UI
- use Database
- add web client
- use UML models

and also for the structure, use "int id", this will
enhance both runtime and will reduce the storage,
because in the FET xml files, for example to store and
activity, you have to write again the name of the
subject, teacher, students and also the day and time
slot in a solution. the same happens in time and space
constraints, these 3 entities represent a big
percentage of the size of the file, so you use int IDs
and not names you will certainly gain a lot of space
and also a better execution time, i know, as you said,
that the internal structure uses int id but for
loading and saving xml files and searching, the usage
of strings delays them.

"How compatible my idea of manual intervention is with the genetic algorithm is not clear to me.
Actually a purely manual approach would probably disallow clashes completely and offer all 
sorts of visual signals to show where activities could or could not be scheduled, 
which activities could be scheduled in a particular period, etc. This is something completely 
different to what you have been working on. Maybe there is some middle way, but I feel some 
of this stuff would actually be necessary (I do not yet believe that it is practicable to 
generate timetables purely automatically - the requirements and constraints are too diverse).

It seems to me, it should be possible (but of course only after a lot of work!) to have 
a beautiful manual timetable editor (which can also print the various timetables, and 
perhaps save the data sets and results in a database) with an interface to an automatic 
timetable scheduler which can be used to speed up the work."

From TheStar:

A constraint to think about is that some activities, and I suspect 'normal school management'
talks about teachers as in "One teacher per x students".

In the HSC year here, it's about one teacher per 26 students (or something like that).
At a recent excursion, it was one teacher per 10 students.  Hope that helps :)

..............................

> Of course, you can add each student. I could have implemented this solution.

You could always autogenerate the students...
"Quick-Build Students"
�[Properties]
�[Number]
�(Build)

And it will generate students with name: AutoGen-11231, ID: 11231, and the like.

The user could then 'select' groups of these students... and... (Just an idea)

From Abdul Hadi Kamel:

Do you have a plan in mind to upgrade the existing fet from standalone
application to a client-server/web-based database oriented type of
application in the future. This is because the current fet is quite limited
especially in terms of timetable data which cannot be keyed-in /view s
amongs several users at the same time. This will cause hardship because the
people involved in making the class timetable in universities normally
consist of several key persons from different departments. Using standalone
application by several persons sometimes make data consolidation process
among departments become difficult and error-prone

I think it will be better if the FET can support a single timetable data
repository (using client-server model) in a database that can be input/view
by several users simultaneously.

From Volker Dirr:
If you think that other people don�t like this default constaint how about
making a menu "default settings". there you can add "langurage" and my
defalut wish. maybe there are other parameters, that can be set in this
settings. i guess that there a people who want set duration to 2 or 4 by
default.

Add the parameter "always maximaize window" in the "settings"

it would be nice to have something like "time constraints (subjects) - max n hours per day the same subject".
so compulsory min n days between activities is nearly similar to compulsory max n hours per day the same subject (except subjects with duration 2 and more)
but non-compulsory min n days between activities is somhing very diffrent then non-compulsory max n hours per day the same subject.
i look forwad to a option like "non-compulsory max n hours per day the same subject".
because it isn�t not to bad if it happen (having a lesson twice a day" only a few times.

or do something like "time constraints (activities) - max n activities with same subject per day"
or "time constraints (activities) - max n (grouped) activities with same subject per day". (but he have to differ between activities and subactivities. is�t nonsens to subactivities, it has just sense with activities.)

From kdsayang

I would like to see FET generate the time table in 

1. certain amount of time for each time table
2. with some setting about the remaining weight soft conflicts
3. generate multiple variants

For example
(A) rules are
(i) the user select to generate 10 minutes time limit for each time table
(ii) user set 0 for remaining weight soft conflicts
(iii) the user select 10 variants

the outcome
(B)
(i) the time table finished and it has generate 10 time table that concur with 0 remaining soft conflicts for each time table
(ii) the time table finish and it only manage to get 5 variants from 0 remaining weight soft conflicts
(iii) the time table finish BUT it don't manage to generate any variants with 0 remaining weight soft conflicts

refer to (B)(iii)

the user can change
(i) longer run time to generate time table (with crossing finger) hehe... Others setting is not change
(ii) longer run time to generate time table with increasing value for remaining soft conflicts (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 etc)

As u can see in timetable --> generate multiple variants, features in (A)(i) and (A)(iii) are already there. I hope that u 

can figure it out on how to implement the feature in (A)(ii). It would be marvelous.

From kdsayang

If a user want to add "an activity have a set of preferred rooms", the user will need to click one 
by one to add right???... So, I would like to suggest that we group them like when user want to add 
an "activity". There (activity), we can select by years, groups and subgroup for students. Instead of 
clicking all the student groups in years 1, user can just click year 1 to include them all into students....
 
For example for rooms (room group then room subgroup)
 
HALL
Hall A
Hall B
Hall C
 
TUTORIAL
A-A1
A-A2
B-A1
 
COMPUTER LAB
Lab 1
Lab 2
Lab 3
 
So when user want to add "an activity have a set of preferred rooms" for all the tutorial room, instead 
of clicking 20 tutorial room one by one, user just click the group that is Tutorial. Easy right???

12---------------------------------------------------------
From kdsayang

What I meant is in Data --> Time Constraints --> Teacher Time Constraints --> A Teachers not available time, 
1. If u double clicked Afida, 
2. It will show Afida not available time right. 
3. Then If u want to change Sambilan not available time by choosing Teacher drop down menu, nothing happen. In fact, It still shows Afida not available time. 
4. So, if u want to change Sambilan not available time, u have to clicked Cancel button first, 
5. then double clicked Sambilan. 
6. Now u can see that Sambilan not available time is updated.

My suggestion is that It will be better If FET can update to Sambilan from Afida in Step no 3.

Hi,
 
I have some other suggestion.
 
1. It will be GREAT if FET can be turn to tree structure. We can show/hide the structure
2. In the tree structure, we can use the copy, cut and paste to edit the subject, activities, etc in the tree structure
 
example of tree structure can be seen in attachment
 
Thanks 

14---------------------------------------------------------
From kdsayang

If  I want to change many teacher not available time, I need to add one by one although the teacher not available time is the SAME.  
 
So, I suggest that u can add A set of teacher not available time. Same as A rooms not available time feature. 

15---------------------------------------------------------
From kdsayang
On current version, there is no group for subject and teacher. It is quite annoying if u have to look for certain subject X and teacher Y in that list. When the list grow bigger (let say 100), it's kinda hard because u have to find that lecture and subject in that 100 lists. Although the sorting is a good way to find the subject and teacher, IMHO maybe we can make groups in that teacher and subject section

For example I wanna find teacher X and subject X. Teacher X is a teacher that teach Diploma IT student. So, I just search that teacher in Diploma IT group rather than searching 100 other list. Same as subject X.

This feature is needed if my/our/your university/school is a big one where teacher and subject are hundreds...

Hi Liviu,

The only improvement that I can think of right now is the printing function.

Where I've demonstrated the software all the users ask why they have to exit out of FET and print through the IE. All would prefer to print directly from FET.

So that might be something you may want to look at.

Best regards
Bobby

In preferred time slots, preferred starting times, break or not available, clicking
on a day or hour (column or row head) will set/reset/toggle all hours (or days) in this slot

Or: make a combo box: column and another combo box: row. Add button "Change", so we can change
a specific row or column by this procedure. - comment Liviu: the dialog would become very complicated.

From Niels (gesamtschule)

yesterday evening we run in to trouble, because we had defined some constraint which makes the problem unsolvable.
To analyze such a situation it would be extremely helpful, if it become possible to filter all constraints.
For example give me all constraints for activity x. This means all which was directly defined to the activity
and all which defined for the subject and the teacher. Is it possible to realize this quickly? Otherwise 
I will start to write an own solution based on the xml-file.

We've created a timetable but the rooms aren't. So we do it by hand.
How can I change in FET the rooms simpiler in a generated timetable?
The times are locked.
It would be the most simplier when I open e.g. the teachers timetable,
click on a activities and I can add room to this.

Yes, imho you understand my problem. I hoped that there is a simplier
solution. So, maybe in the next releases would be nice: when a
timetable is generated, user can changes/sets the rooms (only the
activities without rooms of course) from the timetable (Timetable ->
Show teachers/students): you select an activite, you click a button
with "Assign room" and choose a room.

One more: plus constraint: maximalize the activities in same time -
because of number of rooms.

This is a request for a new feature...
For Teachers and Subjects I like to use a brief description (BD), a code,  and I optionally convert it to corresponding long description (LD) in the generated timetables (I refer to my current timetable procedures). So I need to define two new fields. Example:
Theacher:  MANC, MANCINI
Subjects: MAT, MATEMATICA

I think that this can be achieved without any change to current interface, simply using the format above. Of course I want use the BD only in defining activities and when I have to specify subject and Teacher.
I wish to output the breaf (only BD) or complete (LD) timetables Wink

From Bingen


For the internal organization of my school, it's convenient to have a general timetable for each 
group, A and B, and Untis gives it. But as you observed, the footnote legend style it's not 
probably the best, as it's a little bit difficult to understand. I think in FET a good solution 
could be to be able to define a group of activities for a group (for example A, or even the whole 
year A and B), and then subdivide this group of activities in many subactivities, each of them 
with its own teacher and classroom (I have read the term "subactivity" in the manual, but I 
can't find a definition of it, nor find it in FET menus). So a group would be attending many 
activities at a time, which is not possible right now in FET. Maybe if it represents a structural 
problem FET could define internally subgroups, but being transparent for the user. This activity 
group should have a user defined name to identify (for example "Optative 1"). And then inside, 
each subactivity would have the real subject ("French language", "Arts", etc.). In this way the 
user would avoid to define such a great number of subgoups, and in the teacher's timetable 
everything would appear right and clear, with no reference to the activity group, just to his own 
subactivity, and with information of room besides of the group (opposed to the pseudoactivity 
solution to book the room).

In the group timetable, the common activities would appear as always, and the others would appear 
with the activity group name. Then parallel timetables with blanks in the common activities and 
one of the subactivities for the rest could be printed . So we would need as much timetables as 
the maximum number of subactivities of the largest activity group. Maybe the subactivities could 
be diplayed in couples to avoid many timetables, as it happens now with group timetables and 
"same day+hour" activities.

These parallel timetables could be hanged up on the classroom board, and, of course, each pupil 
should know which of the subactivities has to attend. I think this display should be clearer than 
the footnote legend style. I don't know if I have explained it clear enough, but if not I could 
send a spreadsheet with an example.

Also, with this solution, if no activity group are defined all works as before, so we would avoid 
the problem commented by Liviu of people not needing it.

From Massimo Mancini:

SUGGESTION BY: Massimo Mancini

WHERE: add activity form

WHAT: a check box to lock the total duration of activity

WHY: to introduce an automatic check and alert on the sum of durations of
single subactivities (currently the total duration reflect always the sum,
so if you alter the single duration, FET recompute the total, this can be
what you want or maybe not)

WHEN: all new future are always ASAP :-D (the programmer says...)

FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS: a templates system for automatic generation of activity based
on year and subjects expected for a class of that year (normal italian
situation, abroad I don't know ;-)

26---------------------------------------------------------
From Bingen:

- In my school the timetable is divided in morning (from 8:00 to 14:30h) and afternoon (15:00 to 17:00h). In the morning there's a break from 11:00 to 11:30h. I have defined this break as an hour of the timetable, but not allowing activities for any set of students in this slot. The reason is to plan the surveillance of the teachers in this slot. There must be always 2 teachers looking after the pupils during this period, so I define activities without students. The problem is that if a teacher does not have surveillance at break time, it should not count as a gap. If I define this slot as break in "Misc time constraints" then I can not define the surveillance activities.
- The lunch break is therefore from 14:30 to 15:00 (I have not defined it as a slot of the timetable, because there are no pupils in the school, they are at home having dinner). As it's a short time, often is convenient for many teachers to avoid having class from 13:30 to 14:30 slot and from 15:00 to 16:00 slot in the same day. Maybe something like a constraint of incompatible slots for some/all teachers would do the trick (and could apply to other situations).
- We try that all the teachers work maximum 2 afternoons per week. This has been easy to define with "All teachers work in an hourly interval max days per week". But we try also that teachers who work two days per week in the afternoon to have a free morning. I don't know how to define this situation.
I have seen some custom versions of FET considering the morning / afternoon division. I have to read them carefully, but I think they are not exactly my situation. For example, we don't want the condition "Teachers can only have lesson either in morning or afternoon. never both"...

27---------------------------------------------------------
From Silvia:

Would it be possible to add a time constraint for teachers saying preferred times? I don't mean available times. Sometimes a teacher says: I'd like not to have classes 1st one in the morning, or I'd like not to have classes more than one afternoon. But sometimes a teacher says: I'd prefer to start at first time in the morning. Is that possible?

28---------------------------------------------------------
From T. Renganathan:

2)      You
can give a provision for the user to perform his own sorting of years,
teachers, etc., for e.g., using dragging and dropping.
 
3)      You
can include a provision for multiple selection of subjects, teachers,
activities, etc., for example using Ctrl or Shift key.  This will especially be useful for deleting
multiple entries.

Volker:
please add to TODO. i think this is a nice feature we should not forgot.

Liviu:
I thought about your proposal. I think it cannot be done and I know the reasons why I didn't do that: 
a constraint activities preferred starting times has subject "" or specified. If it is "", then it is for 
all subjects. So, I should write all constraints of this type with subject "" for each subject. But this 
is not correct. A constraint might have a teacher which don't have this subject.

There is no easy way to remove a component.

alfaromeo:
well
to re-use  last year .fet file,
what about
-removing all activities at once, so Data keeps only subjects, teachers and groups ?
or
- removing all teachers from all activities (because teachers dont teach the same groups every year)
or
- removing all groups from all activities

Liviu:

in Statistics, teacher  Eng1 has only 20 hours
in Data  ---> activities, I count 21 hours :-))  for him
finaly, I realised that I has deactivted one hour component by mistake

so, is it possible to add this line into activity window:

Activity group id=1
Duration=1
Total duration=5
Total active: XX

alfaromeo:
- removing all groups from all activities
sorry, removing groups doesnot make sense, because, activities should keep group's information
Groups have the same set of activities every year

So the most important is:
-removing all activities at once, so Data keeps only subjects, teachers and groups ?
but this is not so good, as we will lost time and space constraints related to those activities
So, the best of the best is:
- removing all teachers from all activities (because teachers dont teach the same groups every year)
so we can re-assign new teachers to groups

34---------------------------------------------------------
From Volker Dirr:

Volker:
i thought one more about the "min n hours per day" problem again, because we had a similar discuss at my school.

i think there is "just" a "min days per week for teacherS" constraint needed. doesn't solve that the problem in a good way?

so if you want a min n hours == 1 constraint, then you just add a "min n days per week" constraint.

if you want a min n hours ==2 constraint with allowed free days, then you add a "min n hours per day == 2" constraint.

if you want a min n hours == 2 constraint without free days, then you add a "min n hours per day ==2" and a "min n days per week == daysPerWeek" constraint.

hmm... i am currently just not sure how difficult to code that constraint.

Liviu:
It is easy to code. Just make the teacher(s) min hours daily non-intelligent. But I don't want to add alternative to min hours daily to have intelligent or non-intelligent, because people might obtain impossible timetables. I can tell you what to modify to make this. You'll have to compile your own FET.

I refer to latest snapshot 5.11.0:

In generate.cpp, lines: 7050, 7079, 7113, 7142. Make the tests already true (like add 1|| oldcondition).

This way, you can add min 1 hours daily for necessary teachers. You also need to modify the dialog of min n days, to accept 1 hour (because it only accepts >=2 values). Also, you need to modify in generate_pre.cpp, because FET complains if below 2 min hours.

Volker:
no, i think you didn't understood my idea 100%, because with my variant it is also possible that a teacher still have a definied number of free days, while your solution mean a teacher will never have a free day.
(the number of free days is just 0 if you do a "min n day == daysPerWeek" constraint. but of course it should be also possible to use lower values.
so currently things like that are only possible by workarounds with min hours per day or min n days bewteen activities.
with a min n days per week you don't need that workarounds anymore.

From Frans Cilliers:

About campuses: What I thought is the following. Currently you have min

also be done for campuses, for example minimum gaps between campuses for

you mentioned)

38---------------------------------------------------------
From Kania:

Hi,
Maybe You remember my post from April (many teachers – many groups). Since
than in our team we’ve been trying to adapt our internal solutions to use
FET (it is really Your great success).
We tried to use FET to solve timetable for a pretty big plan (see
attachment with an input file) and by the way we had to solve a few
problems and got some experiences as an end-users. Maybe it would be
interesting also for You.
We are probably the first team where the max-number-of-activities message
appeared (on the FET page I found the information that until now nobody
suggested a larger value than 5000). I decided to use FET on the maximum
scale but to start algorithm I had to remove activities from two whole
faculties and replace it with constraints like Teacher not available time
and Room not available time or leave activities for manual handling. So we
have the first big supplication - if it is possible – please increase the
max number of activities from 5000 to 7500 or even 10 000.
The second problem we had with the calendar. We organize activities in 16
weekends in every semester so we have 32 days in a “week”. The only
solution we found was to exclude 4 dates from the calendar, put a part of
all activities into those 4 dates manually and reduce the number of
activities and days before putting the rest in FET. So we have the second
supplication – please, enhance the calendar up to 32 days.
I didn’t want to ask You to do it earlier as I wasn’t sure I’d be able to
prepare data and didn’t know if the FET would be strong enough for such a
big plan.
        The third problem was to export data from the program we use for planning
(ACCESS database) to FET and than import data back. I pre-assumed I must
enter data to the FET automatically as the number of activities and
constrains is too high to handle them manually. Also a plan generated by
FET had to be automatically imported to our database. I used FET
procedures to import Teachers, Students and Rooms. I also tried to use
FET import procedure for activities too but I had a problem with IDs. FET
generate its own ids but I needed to use my own ones to keep link between
data in the database with those in the FET so finally I decided to
generate input file instead. Fortunately FET doesn’t change ids and
generate perfect XML file (thank You very much) with generated plan and
thanks to known ids I could import data from FET to our database with no
problem. I solved the problem but I think that adding the tag like
<Note></Note> in the activity description for free use is possible and
would be useful.
        The next point. Due to number of constraints we have in our database I
used similar procedure to generate a part of FET input file with teacher
time constraints and room time constraints. Hence I have a question.
Would it be possible to include file path into FET input file to keep
data in a couple of separate files as working with 100 000 lines file is
not fun?
        We prepared the whole procedure for timetabling with FET. First we
planned (in the Access program) activities for VIPs manually. To use FET
we also had to put into the timetable all activities where students from
one group could choose one activity from a several ones (languages and
some lectures) at the same time. That is why in the input files are so
many “permanently locked” activities and activities with many groups and
only 10 students to avoid conflicts with room capability (I used
<Activity_Tag>UL to mark them). Together with these activities we locked
a room by preferred_room constraint. After that I included prepared data
to the FET input file and thanks God, after all we started to generate
the plan. Fortunately FET is smart enough to find mistakes in locked
activities (room and time conflicts) so than we removed conflicts for
already planned activities.
        By the way – during reading the input file I noticed the error that rises
when the number between tags:
<Number_of_Not_Available_Times>NUMBER</Number_of_Not_Available_Times>
was  not exactly the same as the number of constraints in the file. Of
course it is not a bug. It never happens if user use FET to input
constraints. But it forced me to count constraints during generating data
and shows that program is rather “sensitive”.
The first hint for other users is to start with minimum number of
constraints and if FET would generate the plan than thinking about adding
the next ones. In TODO file I found the suggestion of “possibility to
disable constraint without removing it. Such 'Active' checkbox like on
activities dialog”. I admit – it would be nice. Moreover finding a good
plan is just like using 10 knobs increasing one constraint and decreasing
the other so fast access to the constraints window is crucial. I suggest
to put “Time constraints” and “Room constraints” buttons also in the main
menu (or creating any other shortcuts) as these constraints are rather
deep in the menu.
The next suggestion is to change the interface for some constraints
(particularly wherever there is a long list). For instance for the
constraint Max day for a teacher per week if we have many teachers a
simple table like:

| Teacher Name | Max days|
| teacher 1    |     n   |
| teacher n    |         |

with a button “Save all changes” would be great. Now we have to enter
value for every teacher one by one in separate windows.
        After setting constraints we tried to generate the next version of the
plan. We added more and more constraints (for instance WOLNE – dump
activities - free day for student or increasing max day for teacher) and
I was really surprised when FET coped with that. It took from about 1,5
minutes (almost no constraint) to over 20 minutes (with many constraints)
on Intel Core Duo T7250 2GHz 2GB RAM. With too many constrains after
about 10 minutes when I saw no change in the number of placed activities
(neither up nor down) I cut simulation, removed some constraints and
started it over.
        The second hint is not to change too many constraints in one simulation
as it may lead to impossible timetable and than it is difficult to say
which particular constraint was too much.
        Of course there is a lot of work to do. For instance even when two
consecutive activities are placed at one day (the same group and the same
teacher) sometimes there are placed at different rooms what would force
them to needless changing room. I guess that FET is focused on fulfilling
constrains but not on optimizing timetable. Sometimes simple changing of
two activities makes plan better both for students and teachers. I think
that manually improving generated plan is faster than creating many many
more constraints and repeating simulations. And this is the third hint.

From alfaromeo:

When a user click on Data ---> activities
he presenrd with  a list of all activities because filter fields are empty
all activities are listed based on Activity Id
Now, is it possible to a add sort feature like this
Sort by: Teachers
________Students
________Duration
________Subject
________ Act Id
So for example, if you select teachers, all activities will be listed alphapetically in a ascendent order

From Massimo Mancini:

I have another suggestion: an history file where you record all the actions
of the timetabler and theirs effects. If the history was visible in a a frame
in the View timetable forms, I would see scroll the messages without interruption
and with the opportunity to review them (please don't answer that is too
complicated... you can use a tab widget, a tab for the current situation
another for history... the right answer is: GREAT! I add it in TODO! ;-))). 
In general an history file should be a great thing and the base for
undo/rollup features.

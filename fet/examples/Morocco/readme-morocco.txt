For the Moroccan schools, the user alfaromeo (Chafik GRAIGUER) reported that you need to use some tricks, because these schools
split their days into mornings and afternoons and there are also other unusual requirements. In a public discussion on the FET forum
( http://lalescu.ro/liviu/fet/forum/ ), the users: alfaromeo (Chafik GRAIGUER), Volker Dirr and Liviu Lalescu devised some
tricks to be able to solve Moroccan timetables with the official FET. Please see the Hadkourt subdirectory for such an
example file and for detailed description of the used tricks (in English and in Arabic).

The used tricks seem to work good, though they may contain small imperfections (minor things), which you may try to solve using
your own creativity. Please share with us your improvements.

Instructions by Liviu Lalescu about the icon files:

The file fet-text.svg: This file was recreated in Inkscape 0.92.4 by using copy/paste from the old version of the svg file originally created in
the old Inkscape 0.48.4.

To open fet-text.svg: If you do not have it available, you need to download and install the "TeX Gyre Chorus" font. Some possible download
links are: https://ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/tex-gyre or https://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/chorus. I used the OpenType
format, which works with Inkscape. The font is licensed under the GUST Font License (an instance of the LaTeX Project Public License),
which seems to be a permissive/free to use/modify/redistribute license.

More details for this font, according to its authors: "TeX Gyre Chorus is based on the URW Chancery L Medium Italic kindly released
by URW++ Design and Development Inc. under GFL (independently of the GPL release accompanying Ghostscript). TeX Gyre Chorus can be used
as a replacement for the acknowledged font ITC Zapf Chancery(R) (designed by Hermann Zapf, 1979)."

(In fact, the older version of the svg file used the URW Chancery L Medium Italic font.)

The file fet.svg: This file was recreated in Inkscape 0.92.4 by converting from text to path the file fet-text.svg. This way, fet.svg will be universal,
without dependency on the font file.

The different size/resolution .png icons were obtained with the function Export PNG Image from the Inkscape file fet-text.svg (they could have been
obtained from fet.svg as well).

The fet.ico file was obtained using ImageMagick from the 256x256 and 128x128 resolution png icons, with this command:
magick convert 256x256/fet.png fet.png fet.ico

The fet.icns file was kindly contributed by Darren McDonald (who created it from fet.svg using specific macOS tools, by following the instructions
provided on: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/GraphicsAnimation/Conceptual/HighResolutionOSX/Optimizing/Optimizing.html).
